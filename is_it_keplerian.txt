"In the plot of the residuals, the blue line slopes downward from +30 to -30
km/s over about 2000 days.  That’s a rate of 0.03 m/s/day, which is three times
larger than the value we quote in Eq. 23 of our paper.  And that’s the best
fitting slope - I would guess that the 2-sigma limit is in the neighborhood of
0.05 m/s/day."

...

The value Knutson+2014 quote for this (using Wilson 08 CORALIE + Husnoo 12
HARPS + HIRES) is

gamma_dot = -0.0099 + 0.0052, - 0.0054 m/s/day.
corresponding 2-sigma limit: -0.0207 m/s/day

...

The value Michelle Hill found in her initial analysis (using the same RV
dataset) was

gamma_dot = -0.0191 + 0.0068 - 0.0069 m/s/day.
corresponding 2-sigma limit: -0.0329 m/s/day.

These are the values that I considered when I made the assessment that we
wouldn't include our own RV analysis.

However, later in our correspondence, I requested that Michelle include the
out-of-transit HARPS RVs from Triaud 2010 HARPS (new data). If I look at the
table of RVs she used (Table 4 in the attached), it appears that these
additional points were included.  

The output of this second fit gave a slightly higher gamma-dot:

gamma_dot = -0.0253 + 0.0073 - 0.0084 m/s/day.
corresponding 2-sigma limit: -0.0421 m/s/day.

When I look at the initial analysis, it also looks like there might have been
some fudging of the RV uncertainty values.  I will inquire with Michelle about
this.

Also confusing in Table 4 is that from "2454720.58900" to "2454763.72600", the
points are marked as CORALIE, but I believe they are actually the Triaud
points, because they are the new points that were not included in the old
analysis. I will inquire with Michelle about this as well.

...

Anyway yes. The dot(P) limit from acceleration along the line of sight scales
linearly, and this increases

Michelle's reanalysis with the full timeseries gives:

gamma_dot = -0.0123 + 0.0087 - 0.0081 m/s/day.
2 sigma limit = -0.0285 m/s/day.

Fei's analysis, with identitcal data, give:

gamma_dot = -0.00337 + 0.022 - 0.010 m/s/day.
2 sigma limit = -0.02337 m/s/day.

Fei emphasizes: "Because all 3 instruments only covered limited baseline, the
radial velocity drift is very degenerate with the offsets between the
instruments (I allowed all 3 instruments to have independent offsets)."

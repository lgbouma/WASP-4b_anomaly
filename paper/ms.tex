\begin{abstract}
  Space and ground-based transit observations of the hot Jupiter
  WASP-4b have recently shown that its orbital period is decreasing.
  Potential causes of the period change include tidal orbital decay,
  orbital precession, and light-travel time effects.
  In this work we present new radial velocity measurements of WASP-4,
  acquired with Keck-HIRES.
  The new data show that the system is accelerating towards the Earth
  at $\dot{\gamma} = X.XX \pm Y.YY\ {\rm m}\,{\rm s}^{-1}\,{\rm
  yr}^{-1}$.
  The corresponding period decrease explains WASP-4's
  changing orbital period as a light-travel time effect.
  Combining the radial velocities with new speckle imaging limits, we
  find that system's acceleration is likely caused by a
  10-200$\,M_{\rm Jup}$ companion with semi-major axis between 10-100$\,$AU.
  Based on statistics from \citet{knutson_friends_2014}, about 1 in 6
  hot Jupiters are expected to show period decreases commensurate with
  WASP-4 due to acceleration by outer companions.
  Continued long-term radial velocity monitoring of hot Jupiters is
  therefore essential to distinguish tidal orbital decay from
  line-of-sight accelerations.

\section{Introduction}

The issue of whether and how the orbits of hot Jupiters decay due to
tidal interaction with their host stars has drawn significant
attention over the past 25 years
\citep{rasio_tidal_1996,levrard_falling_2009,matsumura_tidal_2010}.
Numerous observations have also been performed (CITE).  These efforts
are now yielding fruit: by combining transit and occultation timing
with radial velocity measurements, \citet{yee_orbit_2020} have shown
that the data for the hot Jupiter WASP-12b are most compatible with
orbital decay.

The present study highlights a point that, though obvious, has perhaps
not yet received due attention.  The point is that observational
programs aimed at identifying orbital decay in hot Jupiters will be
crippled without long-term radial velocity monitoring programs.  The
reason is simple: when the timescale of orbital period change exceeds
the observing baseline, the first deviation from constant periodicity
is always quadratic in the transit number.

While orbital decay may be common (CITE).  line-of-sight accelerations
could be even {\it more} common (CITE Knutson 14, Bryan 16).  Both
manifest to first order identically in transit times (up to the sign
of the line-of-sight acceleration) -- as a non-zero period derivative.
Specifically, \citet{knutson_friends_2014} showed that X\% of hot
Jupiters show some form of radial acceleration in radial velocity
time-series with baselines of YY years.  Assuming a separation
distribution of (WHATEVER), this implies that ZZ\% of hot Jupiters
will {\it always} show a changing orbital period, over timescale of
say 10 years.

% The abundance of giant planets
% exterior to Super-Earth sized systems is also high (CITE Bryan 2019),
% but this is not so much of a concern to us, as their planetary masses
% and therefore tidal timescales are typically expected to be at least
% an order of magnitude shorter than hot Jupiters.

The main focus of this study is the hot Jupiter WASP-4b, which has an
orbital period that from transits appears to be decreasing by about 10
milliseconds per year.  We discovered the timing variations using
data from TESS and a decade of ground-based monitoring
\citep[][hereafter \citetalias{bouma_wasp4b_2019}]{bouma_wasp4b_2019}.
Thereafter, \citet{southworth_transit_2019} reported 22 new transit
times for the system, and confirmed that the updated series of transit
times was consistent with a quadratic ephemeris.  With additional
data, they found a lower best-fit decay rate of $\dot{P} = -XX.X \pm
X.X$ milliseconds per year.
A separate study by \citet{baluev_2019} reported
additional archival transit light curves of WASP-4b, most notably from
the TRAPPIST archive, and a select few other observers.
% \citeauthor{baluev_2019} analyzed their newly obtained
% photometry, along with archival light curves that we omitted from our
% analysis due to systematic uncertainties in the absolute time system.
% \citeauthor{baluev_2019} found that when they used all the available
% TTV data, the need for a quadratic ephemeris was present.  However,
% they pointed out that if they used lower-precision subsets of the
% available timing data, the necessity for the quadratic term decreased.
% This is not particularly surprising.
% \citeauthor{baluev_2019} also pointed out that the
% precise transit times reported by \citet{huitson_gemini_2017} were
% quite important in the time-series.  Overall,
% \citeauthor{baluev_2019} did not find the claim of a
% period decrease convincing.

To determine the origin of the period change, we acquired four
additional radial velocity measurements using Keck-HIRES, extending
the RV baseline from 3 to 9 years.  Previously, the radial velocities
were sparse and showed a weak ($<2\sigma$) linear trend.  Our new
measurements reveal a line-of-sight acceleration of $\dot{\gamma} =
-XX {\rm m\,s^{-1}\,yr^{-1}}$.  This translates to an expected period
decrease simply from the light travel time effect of ZZ milliseconds
per year --- about commensurate with what is observed.
In the following, we avoid the term ``R{\o}mer delay'' as this phrase
typically signifies arrival time delay due to observatory motion. We
are discussing an analog of the Doppler effect for a source with
constant line-of-sight acceleration.

\section{Observations}
\label{sec:observations}

\subsection{Transits}

{\bf Table~N} lists the transit times we used in our analysis.  We
include data from the peer-reviewed literature for which (a) the
analysis was based on observations of a single transit, (b) the
midpoint was fitted as a free parameter, and (c) the time system
specified both the leap second correction (TDB or UTC) and also
whether any barycentric or heliocentric corrections had been
performed.

% FIXME : verify with Michael Gillon that this is true. (P. Evans
% done)
The majority of times are identical to those we collected in
\citetalias{bouma_wasp4b_2019}.  Twenty-two new times reported by
\citet{southworth_transit_2019} are included.  These transits were
observed from the 3.58m NTT and Danish 1.54m telescopes at La Silla,
and the SAAO 1.0m telescope.  Additional timimg
measurements have also recently been reported by \citet{baluev_2019},
based on a homogeneous analysis of archival ground-based observations
taken professional and amateur observers.  We included
twelve of their ``high quality'' transit times acquired by TRAPPIST
(six transits), El~Sauce (four transits), and
\citet{petrucci_no_2013}.  For TRAPPIST and El~Sauce, we verified with
the original observers that correct barycentric and leap-second
corrections had been performed (M.~Gillon, P.~Evans, priv{.} comm{.}).
We omitted the fourteen remaining \citeauthor{baluev_2019}
ETD\footnote{\url{http://var2.astro.cz/ETD}} times due to ambiguity in
whether leap-second corrections had or had not been performed.

The four available occultations tabulated by
\citetalias{bouma_wasp4b_2019} have neglegible statistical value due
to their large uncertainties, and we forgo their use in this analysis.

\subsection{Radial velocities}

% TODO: Details of reduction from Howard or Knutson
After identifying the period decrease in
\citetalias{bouma_wasp4b_2019}, we acquired four additional radial
velocity measurements with the Keck High Resolution Echelle
Spectrometer (HIRES, \citealt{vogt_hires_1994}).  Our observations
were acquired under the purview of the California Planet Survey
\citep{howard_cps_2010}.  The spectra were reduced using {\bf software
X}.  Previously, the HIRES data-points spanned 2010 to 2013
\citep{knutson_friends_2014}.  Our new measurements triple the HIRES
observing baseline to nine years.

The complete set of radial velocity observations is given in {\bf
Table~M}.  Along with the 2010-2019 HIRES observations, there are also
earlier measurements from CORALIE and HARPS.  Following
\citetalias{bouma_wasp4b_2019}, we included the CORALIE measurements
from \citet{wilson_wasp-4b_2008} and \citet{triaud_spin-orbit_2010},
using the homogeneous radial velocities calculated by the latter
authors. We included the HARPS values reported by
\citet{pont_determining_2011} and \citet{husnoo_observational_2012}.
We omitted the HARPS data points taken over three nights by
\citet{triaud_spin-orbit_2010} for Rossiter-McLaughlin observations
because they have a systematic offset from the remaining datasets.

\subsection{Speckle imaging}

A cursory analysis of the new HIRES observations led to our detection
of a linear trend in the residuals after fitting out the orbit of
WASP-4b.  This prompted us to acquire speckle imaging using Zorro at
Gemini-South \citep[see][, and the instrument
web-pages\footnote{\url{www.gemini.edu/sciops/instruments/alopeke-zorro/}}]{scott_nessi_2018}.
Zorro (and its counterpart, 'Alopeke, on Gemini-North) are
dual-channel speckle interferometers that can be used to observe in
narrow-band filters centered at 562$\,$nm and 832$\,$nm.  

We observed WASP-4 twice, on the night of September 11-12 (8 sets of
1000 frames each) and also on the night of September 28-29 (7 sets of
1000 frames each). The second night had better seeing and produced a
slightly better result, which we opt to use for our analysis.

\section{Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

\subsection{Transits}
\label{sec:transit_analysis}

\begin{figure}[t]
	\begin{center}
		\leavevmode
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{f1.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\vspace{-0.7cm}
  \caption{ {\bf Timing residuals and best-fit models for WASP-4b.}
  The vertical axis shows the observed times minus the calculated
  times assuming a constant orbital period.  More opaque points correspond
  to more precise data.  The quadratic ephemeris and its $1\sigma$
  statistical uncertainties are shown in blue.  Neither model fully
  explains the transit residuals (see~\ref{sec:transit_analysis}).
  The binned TESS point (yellow star) is the weighted average of 18
  TESS transits and is for display purposes only.  Its uncertainty is
  slightly larger than the marker size.  The models were fitted to all
  of the individual transit times.
  \label{fig:times}
	}
\end{figure}

We considered two possible models for the observed transit times.  The
first model assumes a constant orbital period on a circular orbit:
\begin{align}
  t_{\rm tra}(E) &= t_0 + PE,\\
\end{align}
where $E$ is the epoch number and $t_0$ is a reference epoch.  The
second model assumes the period changes at a steady rate:
\begin{align}
  t_{\rm tra}(E) &=
    t_0 + PE +
    \frac{1}{2} \frac{{\rm d}P}{{\rm d}E} E^2.
\end{align}
The free parameters are the reference epoch $t_0$, the period at the
reference epoch, and the period derivative, ${\rm d}P/{\rm d}t = (1/P)
{\rm d}P/{\rm d}E$.  We defined the epoch numbers such that $E=0$ is
near the weighted average of the observed times.  This helps to reduce
the covariance between $t_0$ and $P$.  A third possible model that we
did not consider for reasons that will become apparent is a
precessing, eccentric orbit \citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{gimenez_revision_1995,patra_2017}.

We fitted each of the two models by assuming a Gaussian likelihood and
sampling over the posterior probability distributions.  We sampled the
posterior using the algorithm proposed by
\citet{goodman_ensemble_2010} and implemented by
\citet{foreman-mackey_emcee_2013} in \texttt{emcee}.  The prior for
the quadratic model allowed the period derivative to have any sign.

Figure~\ref{fig:times} shows the observed transit times, minus the
best-fit constant period model.  The best-fitting constant-period
model has $\chi^2 = 276$, 91 degrees of freedom, and $\chi^2_{\rm
red}=3.0$.  The best-fitting quadratic model has $\chi^2 = 183$, 90
degrees of freedom, and $\chi^2_{\rm red}=2.0$.  From the reduced
$\chi^2$ values, we can surmise that neither model entirely describes
the transit data that we have collected---there must be some
additional source of signal or potentially noise. In
\citet{bouma_wasp4b_2019}, we found that the quadratic model for the
(less complete) transit data gave $\chi^2_{\rm red}=1.0$.  The only
difference between our old and new transit datasets are the addition
of transit times from \citet{southworth_transit_2019} and
\citet{baluev_2019}.  The worsened $\chi^2_{\rm red}$ could reflect
underestimated statistical uncertainties in these or in fact any of
the transit measurements. It could also reflect systematic errors in
the time-systems in which the transit measurements were recorded,
though we have taken every caution against the latter possibility.
% For purposes of simplicity, we simply accept that the additional data
% have effectively increased the scatter in the transit O-C diagram.
The difference in the BIC \citep{kass_bayes_1995} between the linear
and quadratic and models is $\Delta {\rm BIC} = 89.1$, strongly
favoring the quadratic case.

The best-fit period derivative in the quadratic model is
\begin{equation}
\dot{P}
  = - (2.74 \pm 0.28)\times 10^{-10}
  = - 8.64 \pm 0.89~{\rm ms}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}.
  \label{eq:dP_dt_obs}
\end{equation}
This agrees to within $1\sigma$ of the value reported by
\citet{southworth_transit_2019} ($\dot{P} = - 9.2 \pm 1.1~{\rm
ms}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$).  It is $\approx$3$\sigma$ larger than the rate
of period decrease we found earlier \citep[$- 12.6 \pm 1.2~{\rm
ms}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$;][]{bouma_wasp4b_2019}, presumably because of
missing coverage filled in by \citeauthor{southworth_transit_2019}'s
and \citeauthor{baluev_2019}'s observations.  The other best-fit
transit timing model parameters are reported in {\bf Table~X}.



\subsection{Radial Velocities: WASP-4's acceleration towards the Earth}

%FIXME: perhaps include the WASP-4b phase-fold here too??
\begin{figure}[t]
	\begin{center}
		\leavevmode
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{f2.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\vspace{-0.7cm}
	\caption{
    {\bf Radial velocity observations of WASP-4.} The best-fit Keplerian orbit
    of WASP-4b has been subtracted.  The linear trend inferred from the
    RV data is shown with a black line, with $1\sigma$ errors in gray.
    The trend that would be needed to produce the period decrease seen
    in transits ($\dot{P}= - 8.64 \pm 0.89~{\rm ms}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$) is
    indicated with the purple dotted line.  The four new RV
    measurements presented in this work increased the significance of
    the slope from $\approx$2$\sigma$ to 15$\sigma$.
	\label{fig:rvs}
  \vspace{-0.3cm}
	}
\end{figure}

%FIXME: this entire paragraph copies Bouma+19 too heavily.
We began by fitting a single Keplerian orbit, plus instrument offsets,
jitters, and a long-term trend
\citep[][\texttt{radvel}]{fulton_radvel_2018}.  We set Gaussian priors
on the period and time of inferior conjunction using the values from
Table~4 of \citetalias{bouma_wasp4b_2019}, and fixed the eccentricity
to zero, per the results of \citet{beerer_secondary_2011},
\citet{knutson_friends_2014} and \citet{bonomo_gaps_2017}.  The free
parameters were the velocity semi-amplitude, the instrument
zero-points, the instrument jitters (an additive white noise term for
each instrument), linear ($\dot{v_{\rm r}}$), and optionally
second-order ($\ddot{v_{\rm r}}$) acceleration terms.

%FIXME: this is a janky approach if so??
We found that the best-fitting model with both linear and quadratic
radial velocity terms was marginally preferred (by $\Delta
\mathrm{BIC} = 5.8$) over the best-fitting model with only a linear
term.  Regardless, for consistency with \citet{knutson_friends_2014},
who fixed the quadratic component of the long-term trend to zero, in
Figure~\ref{fig:rvs} we show best-fitting models for the linear-trend
case.  

WASP-4 was found to be accelerating towards our line-of-sight at high
confidence,
\begin{equation}
  \dot{v}_{\rm r} =
     -0.0422^{+0.0028}_{-0.0027}
     \,{\rm m}\,{\rm s}^{-1}\,{\rm day}^{-1}.
\end{equation}
For comparison, before our recent observing run, 
$\dot{v}_{\rm r}$ was thought to be about five times smaller, and was
only marginally significant
\citep{knutson_friends_2014,bouma_wasp4b_2019}.

The system's acceleration towards our line-of-sight causes a decrease
in the apparent orbital period.  The period
derivative expected from radial velocities is
\begin{align}
  \dot{P}_{\rm RV} &= \frac{\dot{v}_{\rm r} P}{c} \\
  \dot{P}_{\rm RV} &= -5.94 \pm 0.39~{\rm ms}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}.
\end{align}
In other words, the majority of the period decrease observed in
transits ($\dot{P}= - 8.64 \pm 0.89~{\rm ms}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$) seems to
be explained by the acceleration of the host star.

An important consideration is whether the measured RV trend is at all
correlated with stellar activity.  We investigate this by analyzing
WASP-4's emission in the Ca II H \& K lines, as quantified with the
chromospheric $S$-index \citep{wright_chromospheric_2004}.  We only
examined the HIRES velocities for this step, since they are the main
source of signal for our analysis.  First, we subtracted the orbital
solution from the Keck-HIRES velocities.  Then, following
\citet{bryan_statistics_2016,bryan_excess_2019}, we calculated the
Spearman rank correlation coefficient between the $S$-index and the
orbit-subtracted velocities.  We found a correlation coefficient of
0.16. Though suggestive, it is not statistically significant (the
corresponding $p$-value is 0.65).  Furthermore, inspection of the
$S$-index timeseries showed no secular or sinusoidal trends, as would
be expected if we were observing a long-term magnetic activity cycle.
The $S$-index values are included in {\bf Table X}.  We conclude that
it would be highly unlikely for the linear trend to be caused by
stellar activity.

	}
\end{figure}


Given a linear radial velocity trend, we can place lower-limits on the
mass and semi-major axis of additional bodies in the system.  As a
quick estimate of the minimum mass required to explain the linear
trend in WASP-4, we turn to \citet{feng_california_2015}.  As they
discuss, the scenario that yields the minimum companion mass for a
system with a linear trend is a companion with $e\approx0.5$ and
$\omega=90^\circ$.  From their Equation~1,
\begin{equation}
 M_{\rm min} \approx 0.0164\,M_{\rm Jup}
  \left( \frac{\tau}{{\rm yr}} \right)^{4/3}
  \left| \frac{\dot{\gamma}}{{\rm m\,s^{-1}\,yr^{-1}}} \right|
  \left( \frac{M_\star}{{M_\odot}} \right)^{2/3},
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ is the observing baseline.
For WASP-4, this yields $M_{\rm min} = 4.7 M_{\rm Jup}$.  Higher mass
companions are allowed, presuming that they orbit further from the
star; at fixed $\dot{\gamma}$, $M_{\rm comp} \propto a^2$
\citep{torres_substellar_1999,liu_crossing_2002}.

High-resolution images can further limit the available parameter space
by setting an upper limit on the semimajor axis, and a maximum
brightness (and thereby mass) of any putative companions.
The procedure we use to combine constraints from both radial
velocities and high resolution imaging has been developed by
\citet{wright_linear_trends_2007}, \citet{crepp_trends_2012},
\citet{montet_trends_2014}, \citet{knutson_friends_2014},
\citet{bryan_statistics_2016,bryan_excess_2019}, and others.

\paragraph{Speckle imaging constraints}

First, we would like to convert the contrast ratios obtained through
the Zorro imaging (Figure~\ref{fig:zorro}) to limits on the masses of
putative companions and their separations from the host star.

To do this, we followed \citet{montet_trends_2014}, and opted to
employ the \citet{baraffe_evolutionary_2003} models for substellar
mass objects and the MIST isochrones for stellar mass objects
\citep{paxton_modules_2011,paxton_modules_2013,paxton_modules_2015,dotter_mesa_2016,choi_mesa_2016}.
We assumed that the system age was 5 Gyr, so that companions would
have fully contracted.

Due to the custom filters of the Zorro imager, and corresponding lack
of synthetic photometry, we further assumed that all sources had
blackbody spectra. While this is clearly false, we do not readily have
access to the planetary and stellar atmosphere models needed for the
consistent calculation with the \texttt{COND03} and \texttt{MESA}
models.  We therefore adopted the effective temperatures and
bolometric luminosities from the \citet{baraffe_evolutionary_2003} and
MIST isochrones.  Using these theoretical quantities and the empircal
Zorro bandpass functions, we calculated absolute magnitudes in the 562
and 832 nm Zorro bandpasses for stellar and planetary mass companions.
Applying the same calculation to WASP-4 itself using the effective
temperature and bolometric luminosity from
\citetalias{bouma_wasp4b_2019}, we derived the transformation from
contrast ratio to companion mass.  The resulting limits are shown as
the cross-hatched region in Figure~\ref{fig:mass_sma}.


\paragraph{Radial velocity constraints}

To derive constraints on possible companion masses and separations
from the radial velocities, we mostly followed the procedure of
\citet{bryan_excess_2019}. 

We began by defining a $75\times50$ grid in true planetary mass and
semimajor axis, with even logarithmic spacing from 1 to 900$\,$$M_{\rm
Jup}$ and 3 to 500$\,$${\rm AU}$.  We then considered the possibility
that an additional companion in any particular cell could explain the
observed linear trend.  In each cell, we simulated 500 hypothetical
companions.

%FIXME: may want to verify that changing the cutoff location, to say
%80Mjup or whatever the minimum BD mass is doesn't drastically alter
%the posterior
We assigned each companion a mass and semimajor axis from log-uniform
distributions within the grid cell. We drew the inclination from a
uniform distribution in $\cos i$.  For companion masses less than
$10\,M_{\rm Jup}$, we drew the eccentricity from
\citet{kipping_beta_2013}'s long-period exoplanet Beta distribution
($a=1.12$, $b=3.09$).  If the companion mass exceeded $10\,M_{\rm
Jup}$, we drew the eccentricity distribution from the power-law $p_e
\propto e^\eta$ reported by \citet{moe_mind_2017} in their
Equation~17.  We emphasize that the long-period exoplanet and
long-period binary distributions are quite different: the exoplanet
distribution is ``bottom-heavy'', with eccentricities preferentially
close to zero. The binary star distribution is ``top-heavy'', with
more eccentricities close to one.  We chose a mass cutoff of
$10\,M_{\rm Jup}$ based on the bound observed by
\citet{schlaufman_evidence_2018} between giant planets, presumably
formed through core accretion, and brown dwarfs, presumably formed via
gravitational instability.

For each simulated companion, we then drew a sample from the converged
chains of our initial model of WASP-4b, plus its linear trend. We
subtracted the planet's orbital solution, leaving the linear trend.
Given $(a_{\rm c}, M_{\rm c}, e_{\rm c}$ for each simulated outer
companion, and the fixed instrument offsets and jitters from the MCMC
chains, we then performed a maximum likelihood fit for the time and
argument of periastron of the outer simulated companion.  We converted
the resulting $75\times50\times500$ cube of best-fit log-likelihood
values to probabilities, and averaged over the samples in each grid
cell to derive a probability distribution in mass and semi-major axis.

The result is shown as grayscale background in
Figure~\ref{fig:mass_sma}.



\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Implications for WASP-4}
Previous possibilities suggested to explain the period decrease of
WASP-4b included tidal orbital decay, orbital precession, and
light-travel time effects \citep{bouma_wasp4b_2019}.  Our new radial
velocity measurements have now shown the least exotic
option---light-travel time effects---is also the most likely
explanation.  Transits show the obital period to decrease by $YY.Y \pm
Z.Z~{\rm ms}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$; the line-of-sight acceleration observed
in radial velocities implies an expected period decrease of $YY.Y \pm
Z.Z~{\rm ms}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$.  
Though the quantitative agreement is not perfect, Occam's razor would
suggest that the line of sight acceleration is probably a sufficient
explanation for the apparent decrease of WASP-4b's orbital period.
% While further radial velocity observations of the system should help
% in determining the mass and semi-major axis of the companion, it seems
% unlikely that additional transit observations will yield near-term
% constraints on orbital decay.

The corresponding requirements for the companion causing the
acceleration are that it is likely either a brown-dwarf or low mass
star, and that it is between $10$-$100\,{\rm AU}$ from the host star
(Figure~\ref{fig:mass_sma}).
Given such a mass, this companion could at one time have influenced
the orbital evolution of the inner giant.
Further radial velocity monitoring should eventually reveal the
orbital parameters and minimum mass of the companion.

\subsection{How many other hot Jupiters are accelerating towards the
Earth?}

We identified WASP-4b's decreasing orbital period as part of a search
for tidal orbital decay.  However, over half of hot Jupiters have
companions outside of $1\,{\rm AU}$ with super-Jovian masses
\citep{knutson_friends_2014}.  Line-of-sight accelerations are
therefore relatively common in hot Jupiter systems. 

To evaluate the importance of these effects in future transit timing
searches, we collected the linear trends reported by
\citet{knutson_friends_2014}, and computed the expected orbital period
derivatives $\dot{P}_{\rm RV} = \dot{v}_{\rm r} P/c$ for all the
systems.
The results are given in {\bf Table~X}, and visualized for hot
Jupiters with significant linear trends in Figure~\ref{fig:pdot_pop}.

Including WASP-4b, 16 of 51 hot Jupiters from
\citet{knutson_friends_2014} show a non-zero radial velocity trend.
About half are positive, and half are negative, and therefore
$\approx$1 in 6 hot Jupiters are expected to show period decreases
commensurate with WASP-4 due to acceleration by outer companions.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We found that WASP-4 is accelerating towards the Earth, at
X.XX m/s/yr.
This seems like the most plausible explanation for the orbital 
period decrease observed in transits~---~not tidal
orbital decay, or apsidal precession.
The most likely parameters for the companion are XXX.
Over half of hot Jupiters have super-Jovian outer companions,
so the light-travel time effect will become an increasingly large nuisance in
the hunt for orbital decay as
the observing baselines for hot Jupiters increase.
The requirement to avoid missing out is to have long-term
radial velocity monitoring with the same spectrograph (or else to
calibrate instrumental offsets by observing the same stars simultaneously).

%TODO: what's the scaling? sigma_P ~ 1/baseline? baseline^2?

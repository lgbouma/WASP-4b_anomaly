\begin{abstract}
    The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) recently observed
    18 transits of the hot Jupiter WASP-4b.  The sequence of transits
    occurred $81.6 \pm 11.7$~seconds earlier than had been predicted,
    based on data stretching back to 2007.  This is unlikely to be the
    result of a clock error, because TESS observations of other hot
    Jupiters (WASP-6b, 18b, and 46b) are compatible with a constant
    period, ruling out an 81.6-second offset at the 6.4$\sigma$ level.
    The 1.3-day orbital period of WASP-4b appears to be decreasing at
    a rate of $\dot{P} = -12.6 \pm 1.2$ milliseconds per year.  The
    apparent period change might be caused by tidal orbital decay or
    apsidal precession, although both interpretations have
    shortcomings.  The gravitational influence of a third body is
    another possibility, though at present there is
    \replaced{no}{minimal} evidence for such a body. Further
    observations are needed to confirm and understand the timing
    variation.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Although the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS\added{,
\citealt{ricker_transiting_2015}}) is designed to detect new planets,
it is also \replaced{performing precise photometric monitoring
of}{precisely monitoring} most of the planets that have been
discovered by ground-based transit surveys over the last two decades.
One \replaced{of the applications}{application} of the new TESS data
is to search for timing anomalies in \added{previously known }hot
Jupiter systems.  Long-term monitoring of hot Jupiter transit and
occultation times should eventually reveal \replaced{two
distinct}{variations caused by three different} \replaced{processes}{phenomena}.

\explain{The following four paragraphs have been modified to add
emphasis to the possibility of an outer planet explaining the timing
deviations. Some background information given in the original
submission has been removed.}

First, the orbits of most hot Jupiters should shrink because of tidal
orbital decay
\citep{counselman_outcomes_1973,hut_stability_1980,levrard_falling_2009,matsumura_tidal_2010}.
Directly measuring the rate of decay might lead to an improved
understanding of how friction dissipates the energy of tidal
disturbances (a problem reviewed by \citealt{Mazeh2008} and
\citealt{ogilvie_tidal_2014}). Second, if hot Jupiter orbits are appreciably eccentric, then long-term
timing studies should reveal rotation of the orbital ellipse within
the orbital plane (``apsidal precession'').  If this effect were
observed, it could yield a measure of the planet's Love number, which
would constrain the planet's interior structure
\citep{ragozzine_probing_2009}.
The most convincing direct evidence yet found for either orbital decay
or apsidal precession of a hot Jupiter is the case of WASP-12b, which
has a transit period that has decreased by about 30~milliseconds per
year over the last decade
\citep{maciejewski_departure_2016,patra_2017}.

The final effect of interest that can produce period changes in hot
Jupiter systems is gravitational acceleration caused by massive outer
companions \citep[{\it e.g.},][Section~4]{agol_detecting_2005}.
Prototypes include WASP-53 and WASP-81, systems in which the inner hot
Jupiters are periodically perturbed by eccentric brown dwarf
companions with semimajor axes of a few astronomical units
\citep{triaud_peculiar_2017}.

% DELETED THE FOLLOWING TEXT FROM SUBMITTED VERSION:
% First, whenever the orbital angular momentum is less than 3 times
% the rotational angular momentum, the system is vulnerable to tidal
% orbital decay \citep{counselman_outcomes_1973,hut_stability_1980}.
% Most hot Jupiters satisfy this condition and their orbits should be
% shrinking \citep{levrard_falling_2009,matsumura_tidal_2010}.  The
% rate of decay, which depends on how friction dissipates the energy
% of tidal disturbances, is difficult to observe directly or calculate
% from first principles. This has been a stubborn source of
% uncertainty in the interpretation of many phenomena in stellar and
% planetary astrophysics (as reviewed by \citealt{Mazeh2008} and
% \citealt{ogilvie_tidal_2014}).
%
% Second, long-term timing studies may reveal apsidal precession, {\it
% i.e.}, the rotation of the orbital ellipse within the orbital plane.
% Apsidal precession has long been observed in eclipsing binaries
% \citep[{\it
% e.g.},][]{schwarzschild_structure_1958,torres_accurate_2010,borkovits_eclipse_2015}.
% For exoplanets, precessing orbits have been detected in a handful of
% cases, including circumbinary systems (Kepler-413
% \citealt{kostov_kepler-413b_2014}; Kepler-453
% \citealt{welsh_kepler_2015}), planets orbiting rapidly rotating
% stars (Kepler-13
% \citealt{szabo_spin-orbit_2012,szabo_mapping_2014},~\citealt{masuda_spin-orbit_2015});
% and systems with multiple interacting giant planets (Kepler-108
% \citealt{mills_kepler-108_2017}; Kepler-693
% \citealt{masuda_eccentric_2017}).  Apsidal precession is not
% regularly observed in hot Jupiter systems because their orbits are
% nearly circular, which may itself be a consequence of star-planet
% tides.  If it could be observed, then as
% \citet{ragozzine_probing_2009} showed it would be possible to
% measure the planet's Love number, which would be a valuable
% constraint on the planet's interior.
%
% So far, the most convincing direct evidence for either orbital decay
% or apsidal precession has come from WASP-12b.
% \citet{maciejewski_departure_2016} and \citet{patra_2017} showed
% that the transit period of WASP-12b has been steadily decreasing by
% about 30~milliseconds per year over the last decade.

Here, we present evidence for a timing anomaly in the WASP-4 system.
The hot Jupiter WASP-4b orbits a G7V star every 1.34 days,
corresponding to an orbital distance of 5.5 stellar radii
\citep{wilson_wasp-4b_2008,huitson_gemini_2017}.  It is a good target
to search for departures from a constant period, because transits
have been observed since 2007.  The orbital eccentricity is less than
0.018 (2$\sigma$), based on the work of \cite{knutson_friends_2014},
who combined the available transit times, occultation times, and
Doppler data.  The sky projection of the stellar obliquity is also
compatible with zero, within about 10 degrees
\citep{triaud_spin-orbit_2010,sanchis-ojeda_starspots_2011}.

In what follows, \S~\ref{sec:observations} presents the new TESS
observations, and \S~\ref{sec:timing} describes our timing analysis.
We tried fitting the data with three models: a constant period; a
steadily shrinking period; and a slightly eccentric, precessing orbit.  A
constant period can be ruled out\replaced{, but we}{. We} cannot
distinguish between the \replaced{latter two possibilities}{
  possibilities of a decaying orbit, a precessing orbit, and the
  unmodeled possibility of an orbit being gravitationally perturbed by
  an outer companion}.  \replaced{Either possibility}{Any of the three
scenarios} would have interesting implications\replaced{, described in
\S~\ref{sec:implications}}{ (\S~\ref{sec:implications}), and more data
are required for a definitive ruling (\S~\ref{sec:future}).}
Appendix~\ref{sec:verify_tess} considers the possibility that the
WASP-4 timing anomaly is due to an error in timestamps in the TESS
data products.  We found this possibility to be unlikely because none
of the other hot Jupiters we examined show a timing offset with the
same amplitude as was seen for WASP-4.

\subsection{Observations}

WASP-4 was observed by TESS with Camera 2 from August 23 to September
20, 2018, within the second ``sector'' of science operations.  The
star is designated as TIC 402026209 in the TESS Input Catalog
\citep{stassun_TIC_2018}.  The pixel data for an $11\times11$ array
surrounding WASP-4 were averaged into 2-minute stacks by the onboard
computer.  The data were downlinked via the Deep Space Network\footnote{\url{https://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov}}, and
the spacecraft timestamps were calibrated against the ground-station
clocks.  The spacecraft clock times were then transformed by the
Payload Operations Center into the {\it Temps Dynamique Barycentrique}
(TDB) reference system.  The images were then reduced to lightcurves
by the Science Processing Operations Center (SPOC) at NASA
Ames~\citep{jenkins_tess_2016}.  During this processing, the SPOC used
the known spacecraft trajectory to compute the barycentric time
corrections on a target by target basis, and expressed the timestamps
as Barycentric TESS Julian Dates (BTJD), which is simply the
\replaced{b}{B}arycentric Julian \replaced{d}{D}ate minus
2{,}457{,}000.  Lightcurves that were flagged \deleted{as Threshold
Crossing Events} by the SPOC pipeline \added{as crossing a transit
detection threshold} were then vetted and released by the MIT TESS
Science Office to the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes on
November 29, 2018~\citep{ricker_tess_alerts_2018}.

We began our analysis with the Presearch Data Conditioning (PDC)
lightcurve\replaced{
  \citep{smith_kepler_apertures_2017,smith_kepler_PDC_2017}}{, which
has had non-astrophysical variability removed through the methods
discussed by \citet{smith_kepler_apertures_2017} and
\citet{smith_kepler_PDC_2017}}.  We \added{then} processed the
lightcurve as follows.  First, we removed all points with non-zero
quality flags.  This removed data that might have been adversely
affected by ``momentum dumps,'' the firing of thrusters and resetting
of reaction wheels\footnote{\added{The spacecraft pointing and
momentum dumps are described in the data release notes:
}\url{archive.stsci.edu/missions/tess/doc/tess_drn/tess_sector_02_drn02_v01.pdf}}
that took place every 2.5 days during sector 2\deleted{
  \citep{tess_data_product_description_2018}}.  The data during these
events were assigned quality flags corresponding to ``Reaction Wheel
Desaturation Event'' and ``Manual Exclude'' \added{\citep[][Table
28]{tess_data_product_description_2018}}.  For WASP-4, these flags
were simultaneously set for 54 distinct cadences, and there were 10
momentum dumps, averaging about 10 minutes of flagged data per dump.
Out of caution, we clipped out an additional 10 minutes before and
after every momentum dump.  We also removed the data within the first
and last hours of both orbits, because of \replaced{ramp-like
systematic effects that appear}{correlated red noise that appears}
during those time ranges. 

All told, we removed 8\% of the original data points, and were left
with 18{,}165 measurements of the relative flux of WASP-4.  We
normalized the data by dividing out the median flux.  We converted the
timestamps from BTJD$_{\rm TDB}$ into BJD$_{\rm TDB}$ by adding the
appropriate 2{,}457{,}000 day offset
\citep{tess_data_product_description_2018}.  Many of these and
subsequent processing steps were performed using
\texttt{astrobase}~\citep{bhatti_astrobase_2018}. We did not
``flatten'' the lightcurves, as is often done with splines,
polynomials, or Gaussian processes.  Instead, we modeled the
out-of-transit flux variations simultaneously with the transit
parameters, as described below.

\subsection{Measuring the transit times}
\label{sec:measurement}

Using the cleaned PDC lightcurve, we applied the Box Least Squares
algorithm \citep{kovacs_box-fitting_2002} to estimate the orbital
period, transit duration, and a reference epoch using the TESS data
alone.  Based on the results, we isolated the data within 4 transit
durations of each transit midpoint.  To find the transit parameters
that best fit the data, we first fitted a line to the out-of-transit
flux measurements surrounding each transit, and divided it out.  We
then created a phase-folded lightcurve \added{from all 18 transits}
and fitted a standard transit model using the analytic formulae given
by \citet{mandel_analytic_2002} and implemented by
\replaced{\citet{kreidberg_batman_2015}}{\citet[][\texttt{BATMAN}]{kreidberg_batman_2015}}
We assumed the orbit to be circular, consistent with the limits from
radial velocities and occultation timing
\citep{beerer_secondary_2011,knutson_friends_2014,bonomo_gaps_2017}.
The free parameters were the reference epoch, the planet to star
radius ratio $R_{\rm p}/R_\star$, the orbital distance to stellar
radius ratio $a/R_\star$, the inclination $i$, two quadratic
limb-darkening coefficients $(u_{\rm linear}, u_{\rm quad})$, and the
orbital period $P$.

We sampled the posterior probability distribution for all the
parameters using the algorithm proposed by
\citet{goodman_ensemble_2010} and implemented by
\replaced{\citet{foreman-mackey_emcee_2013}}{\citet[][\texttt{emcee}]{foreman-mackey_emcee_2013}}.
Table~1 gives the results, which are in reasonable agreement with the
parameters reported by {\it e.g.},
\citet{southworth_high-precision_2009} and
\citet{huitson_gemini_2017}.  Figure~\ref{fig:phasefold} shows the
phase-folded lightcurve.

To measure the transit times, we returned to the `cleaned' PDC time
series and fitted the data within four transit durations of each
transit separately. We used four free parameters: the time of
mid-transit $t_{\rm tra}$, the planet-to-star radius ratio, and the
slope and intercept of a linear trend to account for any slow
variations unrelated to the transit.  We fixed the remaining
parameters at the values that had been determined from the
phase-folded TESS lightcurve.  The uncertainty in each
\added{photometric} data point was set equal to the root-mean-square
(rms) level of the out-of-transit data.

To verify that the measured uncertainties are estimated accurately, we
computed the \deleted{reduced }$\chi^2$\added{ value} for a linear
ephemeris fit to the measured TESS mid-transit times.  We found that
$\chi^2 = 9.2$, with $n=16$ degrees of freedom.  The variance of the
$\chi^2$ distribution is $2n$, so we would expect $\chi^2 = 16 \pm
5.7$.  Visually inspecting the residuals showed that the error
variance had been overestimated, so we multiplied the measured TESS
errors by a factor $f=0.76$, forcing a reduced $\chi^2$ of unity.
This lowered the mean uncertainty of the transit midtimes from $29.8$
to $22.6$ seconds.  We verified that omitting this step did not
appreciably alter any of our conclusions.

Figure~\ref{fig:lightcurves} shows the lightcurve of each individual
transit, the best-fit models, and the residuals.  Table~2 reports the
mid-transit times and their uncertainties.  After binning the
residuals to 1-hour windows, the lightcurves have an rms scatter of
586\,{\rm ppm}.  The pre-launch TESS noise
model\footnote{\url{github.com/lgbouma/tnm}}
(\citealt{winn_photonflux_2013}, \citealt{Sullivan_2015} Section 6.4)
would have predicted an error budget consisting of the following terms
added in quadrature: 410\,{\rm ppm} from photon-counting noise,
202\,{\rm ppm} from detector read noise, and 673\,{\rm ppm} from the
zodiacal background light.  The level of background light appears to
have been overestimated in the model.

We calculated the stellar and planetary parameters in the following
way.  We computed the star's spectral energy distribution based on the
{\it Gaia} DR2 parallax (after making the small correction advocated
by \citealt{stassun_evidence_2018}) and the broadband magnitudes from
the available all-sky catalogs: $G$ from {\it Gaia\/} DR2, $B_T$ and
$V_T$ from {\it Tycho-2}, $BVgri$ from {\it APASS}, $JHK_S$ from {\it
2MASS}, and the {\it WISE}~1--4 passbands, thus spanning the
wavelength range 0.4--22~$\mu$m.  We adopted the effective temperature
from the work by \citet{doyle_accurate_2013}, who determined the
spectroscopic parameters of WASP-4 using high-signal-to-noise
observations with the High Accuracy Radial-velocity Planet Searcher
(HARPS).  Then, we determined the stellar radius through the
combination of the bolometric luminosity and the effective
temperature, using the Stefan-Boltzmann law.  To determine the stellar
mass, we first computed the mean stellar density based on the value of
$a/R_\star$ that gave the best fit to the phase-folded TESS lightcurve
(for the relevant equation, see \citealt{seager_unique_2003} or
\citealt{winn_exoplanet_2010}).  The mass was calculated from the
radius and density, and the orbital distance was also calculated from
the radius and $a/R_\star$.  The planetary radius was calculated as
the product of $R_\star$ and $R_{\rm p}/R_\star$.  Finally, the planet
mass was calculated based on the stellar mass, the radial-velocity
amplitude observed by \citet{triaud_spin-orbit_2010}, and the orbital
inclination.

Table~1 gives the resulting parameters, which we adopted for the
remaining analysis.  \added{The uncertainties in our derived stellar
and planetary parameters are propagated according to standard analytic
formulae, under the assumption that the variables are uncorrelated and
normally distributed.} Our \added{system} parameters are in agreement
with those of previous investigators, but have the benefit of
incorporating the {\it Gaia} parallax
\citep{wilson_wasp-4b_2008,gillon_discovery_2009,winn_transit_2009,southworth_homogeneous_2011,petrucci_no_2013,huitson_gemini_2017}.
By comparing the star's luminosity and spectroscopic parameters with
the outputs of the Yonsei-Yale stellar-evolutionary models, we found
that WASP-4 is a main-sequence star with an age of approximately
$7\,{\rm Gyr}$ \added{\citep{demarque_y2_2004}}.

\subsection{Pre-TESS timing measurements}
\label{subsec:times}

Table~2 gives the transit times we used in our analysis. We included
data from peer-reviewed literature for which the analysis was based on
observations of a single\deleted{, complete} transit, and for which
the midpoint was allowed to be a free parameter. We also required that
the time system be clearly documented. Many of the times were
previously compiled by \citet{hoyer_tramos_2013}. We confirmed that
the times in that paper were in agreement with the original sources
and that barycentric corrections had been performed when needed.

The earliest epoch is from EulerCam on the 1.2-m Euler telescope
\citep{wilson_wasp-4b_2008}.  The second epoch is based on $z$-band
photometry acquired by \citet{gillon_improved_2009} at the VLT 8.2-m
with FORS2.  Subsequent observations were performed by
\citet{winn_transit_2009}, \citet{dragomir_terms_2011},
\citet{sanchis-ojeda_starspots_2011}, \citet{nikolov_wasp-4b_2012},
\citet{hoyer_tramos_2013}, and \citet{ranjan_atmospheric_2014}.
Finally, \citet{huitson_gemini_2017} acquired optical transit spectra
with the 8.1-m Gemini South telescope between 2011 and 2014, one
transit per season.  The per-point standard deviation of their
lightcurves was a few hundred parts per million.  The average
precision in their reported transit times was 5.6~seconds.  Since
these data points carry significant weight in the analysis, we
\replaced{checked}{corresponded with the authors to confirm} that the
timestamps in their data represent mid-exposure times, that the
barycentric correction was performed correctly, and that the time
system of the final results was BJD$_{\rm TDB}$.  These same authors
also used the same instrument and method to analyze other hot
Jupiters, none of which showed a departure from a constant-period
model.  Finally, these authors also measured two transit midpoints
using Spitzer (Baxter et al., in prep); these times agree with the
Gemini South results.

We also compiled the available occultation times, which are given in
Table~3.  The tabulated values have been corrected for the
light-travel time across the diameter of the orbit by subtracting
$2a/c = 22.8$ seconds from the observed time.
\citet{beerer_secondary_2011} observed two occultations of WASP-4b
using warm Spitzer in the 3.6\,$\mu$m and 4.5\,$\mu$m bands.
\citet{caceres_ground-based_2011} detected an occultation from the
ground in the $K_S$ band, and gave a time in HJD, without specifying
the time standard.  We assumed the standard was UTC, and performed the
appropriate corrections to convert to BJD$_{\rm TDB}$.  We verified
that none of our conclusions would be changed if this assumption was
mistaken. Finally, \citet{zhou_secondary_2015} observed an occultation
with the Anglo-Australian Telescope.  They did not report the observed
midpoint, but they did report a result for $e\cos\omega$ based upon
the observed midpoint.  We calculated the implied midpoint using the
formula \citep[{\it e.g.},][]{winn_exoplanet_2010}
\begin{equation}
  t_{\rm occ}(E) =
  t_0 +  P E  +
  \frac{P}{2} \left( 1 + \frac{4}{\pi} e\cos\omega \right),
  \label{eq:occultation_time}
\end{equation}
\added{for $E$ the transit number, $t_0$ the reference epoch, $e$ the
eccentricity, and $\omega$ the argument of pericenter.} In total,
there are four \added{available} occultation times.


\subsection{Analysis}

First, we \replaced{fitted}{performed a weighted least-squares fit of}
a constant-period model (\added{a }``linear ephemeris'') to the
pre-TESS data, and used it to extrapolate to the epochs of the TESS
observations.  The residuals of the best fitting model are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:arrived_early}.  The transits observed by TESS
occurred earlier than expected.  Because the TESS mission is still in
an early stage, we were concerned about a possible offset in the TESS
timestamps due to an error with the TESS clock or the data processing
pipeline.  Appendix~\ref{sec:verify_tess} describes some tests that
convinced us that a simple offset is unlikely. Assuming that the
observed timing variation is astrophysical, we proceeded by exploring
three models for the timing data in a manner identical to the study
by~\citet{patra_2017}.

The first model assumes a constant orbital period on a circular orbit:
\begin{align}
  t_{\rm tra}(E) &= t_0 + PE,\\
  t_{\rm occ}(E) &= t_0 + \frac{P}{2} + PE,
\end{align}
where $E$ is the epoch number.  We defined the epoch numbers such that
$E=0$ is near the weighted average of the observed times.  This helps
to reduce the covariance between $t_0$ and $P$.

The second model assumes the period is changing at a steady rate:
\begin{align}
  t_{\rm tra}(E) &=
    t_0 + PE +
    \frac{1}{2} \frac{{\rm d}P}{{\rm d}E} E^2, \\
  t_{\rm occ}(E) &=
    t_0 + \frac{P}{2} + PE +
    \frac{1}{2} \frac{{\rm d}P}{{\rm d}E} E^2.
\end{align}
The three free parameters are the reference epoch $t_0$, the period at
the reference epoch, and the period derivative, ${\rm d}P/{\rm d}t =
(1/P) {\rm d}P/{\rm d}E$.

The third model assumes the planet has a slightly eccentric orbit, and
that the line of apsides is rotating \citep{gimenez_revision_1995}:
\begin{align}
  t_{\rm tra}(E) &= 
		t_0 + P_{\rm s}E
    - \frac{e P_{\rm a}}{\pi} \cos\omega,\\
  t_{\rm occ}(E) &= 
    t_0 + \frac{P_{\rm a}}{2} + P_{\rm s}E
    + \frac{e P_{\rm a}}{\pi} \cos\omega,
\end{align}
where $P_{\rm s}$ is the sidereal period, $e$ is the eccentricity,
$P_{\rm a}$ is the anomalistic period, and $\omega$ is the argument of
pericenter.  In this model the angular velocity of the line of apsides
${\rm d}\omega/{\rm d}E$ is constant,
\begin{equation}
  \omega(E) = \omega_0 + \frac{{\rm d}\omega}{{\rm d}E} E,
\end{equation}
and the sidereal and anomalistic periods are connected through the
equation
\begin{equation}
  P_{\rm s} = P_{\rm a} \left(
    1 - \frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{{\rm d}\omega}{{\rm d}E}
    \right).
\end{equation}
\added{The sidereal period is the duration required to return to the
same orientation with respect to the stars; the slightly longer
anomalistic period is the duration required to reach a fixed longitude
with respect to the rotating line of apsides.} The five free
parameters of this model are $(t_0, P_{\rm s}, e, \omega_0, {\rm
d}\omega/{\rm d}E)$, denoting the reference epoch, the sidereal
period, the eccentricity, the argument of pericenter at the reference
epoch, and the angular velocity of the line of apsides.

\added{We fitted each model by assuming a Gaussian likelihood and
sampling over the posterior probability distributions. The prior for
the quadratic model allowed the period derivative to have any sign.}
Figure~\ref{fig:times} shows the residuals with respect to the
constant-period model.  The best-fitting constant-period model has
$\chi^2 = 174$ and 61 degrees of freedom.  The best-fitting
\replaced{decreasing-period}{quadratic} model has $\chi^2 = 62.6$ and
60 degrees of freedom.  The best-fitting precession model has $\chi^2
= 64.3$ and 58 degrees of freedom.  Either of the latter two models
provides a much better fit than the constant-period model.  The
difference in $\chi^2$ between the first and second models corresponds
to $p \approx 10^{-26}$.

The \replaced{decreasing-period}{quadratic} model provides a slightly
better fit to the data than the precession model.  It is favored by
$\Delta \chi^2 = 1.7$, and has two fewer free parameters.  A useful
heuristic for model comparison is the Bayesian Information Criterion
(BIC),
\begin{equation}
  {\rm BIC} = \chi^2 + k\log n,
\end{equation}
where $k$ is the number of free parameters, and $n$ is the number of
data points. In this case, $n=62$.  The difference in the BIC between
the precession and decay models is $\Delta {\rm BIC} = {\rm BIC}_{\rm
prec} - {\rm BIC}_{\rm quad} = 10$, corresponding to a Bayes factor of
$1.1\times 10^{4}$.  Likewise, the Akaike Information Criterion favors
the constant-period-derivative model by $\Delta {\rm AIC} = 5.8$.
Differences of this magnitude are traditionally deemed ``strong
evidence'' that one model is a better description of the data than the
other \citep{kass_bayes_1995}, although we prefer to reserve judgment
until more data can be obtained.

In the \replaced{decreasing-period}{quadratic} model, the period
derivative is
\begin{equation}
\dot{P}
  = - (4.00 \pm 0.38)\times 10^{-10}
  = - 12.6 \pm 1.2~{\rm ms}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}.
  \label{eq:dP_dt_obs}
\end{equation}
For comparison, the best-fitting period derivative of WASP-12b is
$\dot{P} = -29 \pm 3\,{\rm ms}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$
\citep{maciejewski_departure_2016,patra_2017}.  If both planets are
truly falling onto their stars, then WASP-4b is falling at about half
the rate of WASP-12b.

In the precession model, the best-fit eccentricity is
\begin{equation}
  e = (1.92^{+ 1.93}_{- 0.76})\times10^{-3}
  \label{eq:e_obs}
\end{equation}
The longitude of periastron advances by $\dot{\omega} =
13.6^{+4.7}_{-3.6}\ {\rm degrees}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, and the precession
period is $27^{+10}_{-7}$ years.  All of the best-fitting parameters
(the medians of the posterior distributions) and the 68\% credible
intervals are reported in Table~4.

\explain{The following subsection has been added since the original
submission, per the referee's suggestions.}
\subsection{Possible systematic errors}

To assess the robustness of these results, we considered a few
possible systematic effects in the timing dataset.  

\paragraph{Suspect pre-TESS light curves}
Some of the
pre-TESS light curves have incomplete phase coverage: a handful
of the transit times in Table~2 are from lightcurves with 
gaps.  A separate issue is the effect of spot-crossing anomalies on
transit timings.  To address these concerns, we repeated
the model-fitting described above, but omitted epochs -827, -804,
-537, and -208 because of gaps in their coverage.  We also omitted
epochs -526 and -561 because of visible spot anomalies during the
transits. (All epoch numbers are as in Table~2.)  The resulting
best-fit transit timing model parameters were all within $1\sigma$ of
the values quoted in Table~4.  The uncertainties, goodness-of-fit
statistics, and model comparison statistics did not appreciably
change.

\paragraph{Spot-crossing events in TESS data}
To explore the effect of possible spot-crossing events on the TESS
transit time measurements, we performed a separate test.  We injected
triangular spot-anomalies with amplitude $0.03\%$ and duration 30
minutes at random phases into each transit.  The amplitude was
chosen to be larger than the spot-crossing anomalies observed by
\citet{southworth_high-precision_2009} and
\citet{sanchis-ojeda_starspots_2011}, and the duration was chosen
to be comparable to those of previously observed events.
Spots of these amplitudes resemble the possible anomalies present
in transits ``1360.54'' and ``1372.58'' of Figure
\ref{fig:lightcurves}.

With spots injected, we repeated our measurement of the transit times.
On average, the measured transit times did not change after injecting spots,
because the flux deviations are equally likely to occur
in the first and second halves of the transit. 
For individual transits, there were no cases for which the
timing deviation was larger than one minute.  The largest 
shifts occur when the spot anomaly occurs during transit ingress or egress, in
which case the measured mid-time is shifted early by between 30 and 50
seconds \citep[qualitatively similar to results found
by][]{ioannidis_how_2016}.

Therefore the TESS observations could hypothetically all be skewed
early if there were spot-crossing events during every egress.  Two
arguments rule out this possibility.  (1) The lightcurve residuals do
not show evidence for these events.  (2) The stellar rotation period
is between 20 and 40 days, and the sky-projected stellar obliquity is
less than 10 degrees
\citep{triaud_spin-orbit_2010,sanchis-ojeda_starspots_2011,hoyer_tramos_2013}.
Since the planet orbits every 1.3 days, requiring that spot anomalies
always occur during egress would be equivalent to requiring a stellar
spot distribution that is exquisitely (and thus implausibly)
distributed to match the planet egress times.

\paragraph{Detrending choices in pre-TESS data}
There is a final concern that is difficult to address.  We
collected the mid-transit time values derived by different
authors, who used heterogeneous methods to fit and detrend their
lightcurves.  We have also assumed that these authors
have correctly documented the time systems in which the data are
reported.  Further, though many
choices in transit-fitting ({\it e.g.}, parametrization of
limb-darkening and eccentricity) do not affect transit mid-time
measurements, different detrending approaches can asymmetrically warp
transits and shift mid-transit times.  The magnitude of this
systematic effect is hard to quantify, but the situation is fairly
clear from Figure~\ref{fig:times}.  Many independent authors provided
transit measurements shortly after WASP-4b's discovery, and the data are
consistent with each other. \citet{huitson_gemini_2017} provided
the most important data from epochs 0-1000. If their data were
systematically affected by detrending choices or time-system confusion
at the level of several
times their reported uncertainties, then it possible that the orbital
period is constant despite the evidence in the TESS data.
For this reason, we paid careful attention to the
\citet{huitson_gemini_2017} data set, and corresponded with the authors
to confirm that their results are not affected by systematic 
effects of the required amplitude.

None of the concerns mentioned in this subsection seem likely
to explain the observed timing variations. We proceed by
considering possible astrophysical explanations.

\subsection{Orbital decay}

If the timing variation is \deleted{being caused }caused entirely by
orbital decay, then \replaced{the}{the best-fit model parameters yield a}
characteristic\replaced{ timescale of the decay is}{ decay timescale of}
\begin{equation}
  \frac{P}{ {\rm d}P/{\rm d}t } = 9.2 \, {\rm Myr}.
\end{equation}
For comparison, the corresponding time for WASP-12b is 3.2\,Myr
\citep{patra_2017}.

If WASP-4 really is undergoing rapid orbital decay, then how many of
the other known hot Jupiters should have orbits that are decaying at
detectable (or nearly detectable) rates?  Figure~\ref{fig:context}
compares some key properties of WASP-4 with those of a larger ensemble
of hot Jupiters.  The middle panel displays two parameters that
strongly affect the expected orbital decay timescale, $P
M_\star/M_{\rm p}$ and $a/R_\star$.  WASP-4 has one of the shortest
theoretical timescales for orbital decay.  \replaced{There
are}{Figure~\ref{fig:context} shows} about 20 hot Jupiters (including
WASP-12) for which the theoretical timescale is shorter.  In almost
all of those cases, though, the planet was discovered more recently
than WASP-4 and a decade-long baseline of observations is not yet
available.  A separate consideration not shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:context} is that the hot Jupiter host stars have a
variety of different structures, from being fully convective to nearly
fully radiative, which may lead to widely divergent tidal dissipation
timescales.

In the simple ``constant phase lag'' model for tidal interaction
\citep{zahn_tidal_1977}, the rate of dissipation can be parametrized
by a modified\footnote{For stars, $k_\star \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$,
so it is important to explicitly distinguish $Q_\star'$ from $Q_\star$
\citep[{\it e.g.},][]{schwarzschild_structure_1958}.} quality factor,
$Q_\star' = 3 Q_\star / (2k_\star)$.  Here, $Q_\star$ is the ratio
between the energy stored in the equilibrium deformation of the star
and the energy lost to heat per tidal period \citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{goldreich_q_1966}.  A larger $Q_\star$ implies less
efficient tidal dissipiation. The dimensionless number $k_\star$ is
the stellar Love number, which is smaller when the star's density
distribution is more centrally concentrated.  In this model, once the
planet's spin and orbit are synchronized, then the semi-major axis and
eccentricity evolve as \citep[Appendix B of][]{metzger_optical_2012}
\begin{align}
  \frac{1}{\tau_{\rm e}} &=

    \left( \frac{M_{\rm p}}{M_\star} \right)
    \left( \frac{1}{P} \right).
  \label{eq:da_dt}
\end{align}
The orbital period evolves as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dP_dt}
  \dot{P} = -\frac{27\pi}{2 Q_\star'}
            \left(\frac{M_{\rm p}}{M_\star}\right)
            \left(\frac{R_\star}{a}\right)^5.
\end{equation}
The modified quality factor of WASP-4 corresponding to the observed
value of $\dot{P}$ is
\begin{equation}
  Q_\star' = (2.9 \pm 0.3)\times10^4.
\end{equation}
This is about an order of magnitude lower than the value that was
inferred for WASP-12b.  It is also smaller than most theoreticians
would have expected.  The $Q_{\rm Jup}'$ value of Jupiter is estimated
to be $\approx$$1.4 \times 10^5$, based on the observed motions of the
Galilean moons \citep{lainey_strong_2009}.  For stars, studies of the
binary eccentricity distribution have been interpreted with tidal
models, giving $Q_\star' \approx 10^5 - 10^7$ \citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{meibom_robust_2005,belczynski_compact_2008,
geller_direct_2013,milliman_wiyn_2014}.  Population studies of hot
Jupiter systems have also been undertaken, generally finding $Q_\star'
\approx 10^5 - 10^8$ using different models
\citep{jackson_observational_2009,hansen_calibration_2010,penev_constraining_2012,penev_empirical_2018,cameron_hierarchical_2018}.
For instance, motivated by the rapid rotation of some hot Jupiter
hosts
\citep{pont_empirical_2009,ciceri_hats-15b_2016,penev_hats-18b_2016},
\citet{penev_empirical_2018} modeled the evolution of hot Jupiter
systems under the influence of a magnetized wind and a constant
phase-lag tide.  For WASP-4, their method gave $Q_\star' \approx
(1.2^{+1.0}_{-0.5})\times10^7$, which would correspond to $\dot{P}
\approx -30$ microseconds per year.  This strongly disagrees with the
the period change that we have observed.

\citet{essick_orbital_2016} studied the problem of the orbital decay
of hot Jupiters using a theory in which gravity modes are excited at
the base of the stellar convective zone, propagate inward through the
radiative core and break near the stellar core, leading to energy
dissipation.  They predicted the stellar quality factors in hot
Jupiter systems to vary from $Q_\star' \approx 10^5 - 10^6$.  From
their Equation 26, the prediction for WASP-4 is $Q_\star' =
7\times10^5$, which is an order of of magnitude larger than implied by
the observed period change.

The applicability of the \citet{essick_orbital_2016} model depends on
the evolutionary state of the star. \citet{weinberg_tidal_2017} showed
that more rapid dissipation --- enough to account for the period
change of WASP-12b --- could exist in stars that have begun evolving
into red giants.  The bottom panel of Figure~\ref{fig:context} shows a
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of hot Jupiters hosts, including WASP-4.
On the y-axis is $G=g-\mu$, for $g$ the apparent {\it Gaia}-band magnitude,
and $\mu$ the distance modulus reported by
\citet{gaia_collaboration_gaia_2018}.  The x-axis is the effective
temperature from \citet{bonomo_gaps_2017}, which for WASP-4 agrees
within $1\sigma$ of that from Table~1.  Inspecting the HR diagram,
WASP-4 shows little evidence of being evolved, in agreement with our
analysis from \S~\ref{sec:system_parameters}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% By a similar argument though, WASP-12 would not clearly stand out as a
% candidate subgiant, and \citet{weinberg_tidal_2017} suggest it may in
% fact be a subgiant (though \citealt{bailey_understanding_2019} do not
% find evidence that supports this suggestion).  A more thorough
% isochronal analysis would be of interest, particularly if the transit
% and occultation times continue to vary.  Such an analysis is beyond
% the scope of this study.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To summarize, if the observed period change is caused entirely by
tidal orbital decay, then the constant-phase-lag tidal model implies a
stellar tidal dissipation rate that is higher than expected by at
least an order of magnitude.  It might be possible that we are
observing at a special time, shortly after the planet's inward
migration, or when the planet is near resonance with a stellar
oscillation mode.  Tidal dissipation rates might also be increased if
the star is just turning off the main sequence.  Another hypothesis,
recently advanced by \citet{millholland_obliquity_2018} for the case
of WASP-12b, is that an exterior planet could be trapping WASP-4b's
spin vector in a high-obliquity state, leading to rapid dissipation
through planetary obliquity tides.


\subsection{Apsidal precession}
\label{sec:apsidal_precession}

If instead the observed timing variation is just a small portion of an
apsidal precession cycle, then the orbital eccentricity is a few times
$10^{-3}$, and the full precession period is about 27 years.
\citet{ragozzine_probing_2009} calculated apsidal precession periods
for hot Jupiters, finding them to range between about 10 and 100
years. They highlighted that for many hot Jupiters, including WASP-4b,
the theoretical precession rate is dominated by the non-Keplerian
force due to the planet's tidal bulge.  Precession from general
relativity, the planet's rotational bulge, and the star's rotational
and tidal bulges contribute at the 10\% level at most.  Thus, a
measurement of the precession rate can be used to determine the
planet's Love number.  From their Equation 14, the implied Love number
for WASP-4b is
\begin{equation}
k_{2,{\rm p}} = 1.5^{+2.1}_{-1.1}.
\end{equation}
For comparison, the Love number of Jupiter is about 0.55
\citep{wahl_tidal_2016,ni_empirical_2018}, and a uniform density
sphere has $k_2 = 1.5$. The uncertainty in $k_{2,{\rm p}}$ for WASP-4b
is large because the eccentricity, reference time, and ${\rm
d}\omega/{\rm d}E$ have strongly correlated errors, and the measured
occultation times only barely constrain these parameters
(Figure~\ref{fig:future}).

The main problem with the apsidal precession hypothesis is to explain
why the eccentricity would be as large as $\sim$$10^{-3}$ despite
rapid tidal circularization.  For WASP-4, Equation~\ref{eq:de_dt}
gives $\tau_e = 0.29 (Q_{\rm p}'/10^5) \, {\rm Myr}$.  The star is
several billion years old, so unless the planet arrived very recently,
any initial eccentricity should have been lowered well below
$\sim$$10^{-3}$.  The top panel of Figure~\ref{fig:context} compares
the expected eccentricity damping time of WASP-4b with that of other
transiting giant planets.  WASP-4b has one of the shortest known
eccentricity damping times.

\paragraph{Neighboring companion}
One way to maintain a significant eccentricity is through the
gravitational perturbations from another planet.
\citet{mardling_long-term_2007} considered the long-term tidal
evolution of hot Jupiters with companions.  The companion in their
model is coplanar, and can have a mass down to an Earth-mass; the main
requirement is that both the hot Jupiter and the outer companion start
on eccentric orbits.  They found that although the early phases of the
two-planet eccentricity evolution occur quickly, the final phase of
the joint eccentricity evolution towards circularity would occur on
timescales several orders of magnitude longer than the circularization
time of an isolated hot Jupiter (see their Figures~4 and 5).
 
A separate way a neighboring companion could excite the hot Jupiter's
eccentricity is through the
Kozai-Lidov mechanism \citep{lidov_evolution_1962,kozai_secular_1962}.
In this case, the orbital plane of the outer companion, ``c'', would
need to be inclined relative to that of the hot Jupiter, ``b'', by at
least $\sin^{-1} \sqrt{2/5} \approx 39^\circ$.
For the Kozai-Lidov mechanism to operate at maximum efficiency, we
need \citep[][Equation 20]{bailey_understanding_2019}
\begin{equation}
  M_{\rm c} > 7.5\,M_\oplus
  \times \left( \frac{a_{\rm c}}{a_{\rm b}} \right)^{3/2},
  \label{eq:kozai_bound}
\end{equation}
\replaced{where $M_{\rm b,c}$ and $a_{\rm b,c}$ are the mass and semi-major 
axis of WASP-4b and the hypothetical WASP-4c, and owing}{where $a_{\rm b}$ is 
the semi-major axis of WASP-4b, $M_{\rm c}$ is the mass of the hypothetical 
WASP-4c, and $a_{\rm c}$ is WASP-4c's semi-major axis. Owing}
to our imprecise
measurement\added{, in Equation~\ref{eq:kozai_bound}} we have assumed 
WASP-4b's Love number is $k_{2,{\rm
b}}\approx 0.6$\added{, similar to Jupiter}.  For the RV signal of the 
companion to remain
undetected, it would need to be in the residual $({\rm O-C})_{\rm RV}
= 15.2\,{\rm m s}^{-1}$ reported by \citet{triaud_spin-orbit_2010}.
Again following \citet{bailey_understanding_2019}, this implies
\begin{align}
  M_{\rm c} &<
  ({\rm O-C})_{\rm RV}
  \left( \frac{M_\star a_b}{G} \right)^{1/2}
  \left( \frac{a_c}{a_b} \right)^{1/2}
  f^{-1/2}
  \nonumber
  \\
  M_{\rm c} &< 
  23.7\,M_\oplus
  \times 
  \left( \frac{a_c}{a_b} \right)^{1/2}
  f^{-1/2},
  \label{eq:rv_bound}
\end{align}
for $f(e_{\rm c},\omega_{\rm c}, i_{\rm c}) \propto \sin^2 i_{\rm c}$
a geometric prefactor that depends on the argument of periastron
$\omega_{\rm c}$ and inclination $i_{\rm c}$ of the exterior companion
(\citealt{bailey_understanding_2019} Equation 23).  Since WASP-4b is
transiting, $f$ can be arbitrarily small, and both of the preceding
limits can be satisfied. 

\paragraph{Fluctuations in the gravitational potential from convection}
An independent mechanism to pump the eccentricity invokes the
gravitational fluctuations from stellar convection \citep[][Section
7]{phinney_pulsars_1992}.  From equation 7.33 of that work, the
mean-squared eccentricity of the orbit is
\begin{equation}
  \langle e^2 \rangle =
  \frac{ 2 \langle E_{\rm e} \rangle }{\mu n^2 a^2}
  = 6.8\times10^{-5}
  \frac{(L^2 R_{\rm conv}^2 M_{\rm conv}^2)^{1/3}}{\mu n^2 a^2},
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the stellar luminosity, $R_{\rm conv}$ and $M_{\rm conv}$
are the width and mass of the convective region, $\mu$ is the reduced
mass, $n$ is the orbital frequency, and $a$ is the semi-major axis.
\added{For the luminosity, reduced mass, and semi-major axis, we used
values from Table~1, combined with the Stefan-Boltzmann law and
standard definitions. To estimate the width and mass of the convective
region we ran the MESA code for a star with mass and metallicity
matched to WASP-4, and the input physics detailed in the MIST
isochrones project
\citep{paxton_modules_2011,paxton_modules_2013,paxton_modules_2015,dotter_mesa_2016,choi_mesa_2016}.
We identified the tachocline boundary using the mixing types specified
in the resulting radial profiles, and found $R_{\rm conv} \approx 0.33
R_\odot$, and $M_{\rm conv} \approx 9\times10^{-4} M_\odot$. } For
WASP-4, this implies $\langle e^2 \rangle^{1/2} \lesssim 10^{-5}$.
Hence, this mechanism does not seem capable of producing the required
eccentricity of $\sim$$10^{-3}$.


\explain{The subsequent subsection adds a description of our RV
analysis, which we did not include in the original submission. Some of
the material was taken from what was previously the "Other possible
explanations" section.}
\subsection{Timing variation due to line of sight acceleration}

\begin{figure}[t]
	\begin{center}

		\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{f6.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\vspace{-0.7cm}
	\caption{
    {\bf Radial velocities of WASP-4 (top), and residuals from the
    best-fit Keplerian model (bottom).} The lower panel shows the
    best-fit linear trend inferred from the RV data (black line,
    $1\sigma$ errors in gray), and the trend that would be needed to
    produce the period decrease seen in transits (purple dotted line).
    Since both the RV and transit timing datasets are sparse after
    2013, a distant massive companion on an eccentric orbit might
    still explain the observations.
	\label{fig:rvs}
  \vspace{-0.3cm}
	}
\end{figure}

An acceleration of the center of mass of the system towards our line
of sight could cause a decrease in the apparent orbital period.  The
period derivative would be
\begin{equation}
	\dot{P} = \frac{\dot{v}_{\rm r} P}{c},
\end{equation}
where $\dot{v}_{\rm r}$ is the time derivative of the radial velocity.

\citet{knutson_friends_2014}, combining radial-velocity data from
their own program with those of \citet{wilson_wasp-4b_2008},
\citet{pont_determining_2011}, and \citet{husnoo_observational_2012},
found evidence for long-term trend in WASP-4, with low statistical significance:
\begin{equation}
  \dot{v}_{\rm r} =
     -0.0099^{+0.0052}_{-0.0054}
     \,{\rm m}\,{\rm s}^{-1}\,{\rm day}^{-1}.
\end{equation}
This acceleration translates to an expected $\dot{P} = -(4.4 \pm 2.4)
\times10^{-11}$. The period decrease from the observed RV trend is an
order of magnitude smaller than the observed $\dot{P}$ from transit
times, $(4.0\pm 0.4)\times10^{-10}$ (Table~4).

Nonetheless, it is intriguing that the host star shows a weakly
significant acceleration, and with the correct sign needed to explain
the transit timing variations.  Given the potential importance of the radial velocities for
interpreting this system, we performed an independent analysis,
as follows.  

First, we collected the usable RV measurements from CORALIE, HARPS,
and HIRES.  We included the CORALIE measurements from
\citet{wilson_wasp-4b_2008} and \citet{triaud_spin-orbit_2010}, using
the homogeneous radial velocities calculated by the latter authors. We
included the HARPS values reported by \citet{pont_determining_2011},
which are identical to those from \citet{husnoo_observational_2012}.
We omitted the HARPS data points taken over three nights by
\citet{triaud_spin-orbit_2010} for Rossiter-McLaughlin observations
because they were calculated using a different pipeline than the
longer-baseline \citealt{pont_determining_2011} HARPS measurements,
and necessary inclusion of an extra offset term would nullify their
statistical value.  Finally, we included the five HIRES measurements
taken over many years by \citet{knutson_friends_2014}.  

We then fitted a single Keplerian orbit, plus instrument offsets,
jitters, and a long-term trend
\citep[][\texttt{radvel}]{fulton_radvel_2018}.  We set Gaussian priors
on the period and time of inferior conjunction using the values from
Table~4, and fixed the eccentricity to zero, consistent with results
from \citet{beerer_secondary_2011}, \citet{knutson_friends_2014} and
\citet{bonomo_gaps_2017}.  The remaining free parameters were the
velocity semi-amplitude, the instrument zero-points, the instrument
jitters (an additive white noise term for each instrument), linear
($\dot{v_{\rm r}}$), and optionally second-order ($\ddot{v_{\rm r}}$)
acceleration terms.

We found that the best-fitting model with both linear and quadratic
radial velocity terms was marginally preferred (by $\Delta
\mathrm{BIC} = 5.8$) over the best-fitting model with only a linear
term.  Regardless, for consistency with \citet{knutson_friends_2014},
who fixed the quadratic component of the long-term trend to zero, in
Figure~\ref{fig:rvs} we show best-fitting models for the linear-trend
case.  The best-fit value for the line of sight acceleration,
\begin{equation}
  \dot{v}_{\rm r} =
     -0.0077^{+0.0052}_{-0.0047}
     \,{\rm m}\,{\rm s}^{-1}\,{\rm day}^{-1},
\end{equation}
is within $1\sigma$ of the value reported by
\citet{knutson_friends_2014}. (Note that the CORALIE data used in our
and their analyses differ, as we included additional measurements
reported by \citealt{triaud_spin-orbit_2010}).  The implied period
derivative is still therefore about an order of magnitude smaller than
our observed $\dot{P}$ from transit timing.

To summarize, only about one tenth of the observed period decrease can
be explained through a constant acceleration of the WASP-4 system's
center of mass.  However, given the limited amount and uneven time
coverage of the existing radial-velocity data (Figure~\ref{fig:rvs}),
it remains possible that the center of mass has a more complex motion,
perhaps due to a companion on an eccentric orbit \citep[{\it e.g.},
WASP-53 or WASP-81][]{triaud_peculiar_2017}.  It would be useful to
gather more radial-velocity data to confirm or refute this
possibility.


\subsection{Applegate effect}

A separate candidate explanation for the timing deviations is the
\citet{applegate_mechanism_1992} effect.  Some eclipsing binaries
exhibit period modulations with amplitudes of $\lesssim 0.05\,{\rm
days}$ over timescales of decades \citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{soderhjelm_geometry_1980,hall_relation_1989}.  The Applegate
mechanism explains these modulations by positing that the internal
structure of a magnetically active star changes shape via cyclic
exchange of angular momentum between the inner and outer zones of the
star.  This model could also apply to a hot Jupiter orbiting a star
with a convective zone.  The changing gravitational quadrupole of the
star would cause the orbit of the planet to precess on the timescale
of the stellar activity cycle.  An essential difference between this
process and apsidal precession is that Applegate timing variations
need not be strictly periodic \citep[{\it
e.g.},][Figure~12]{soderhjelm_geometry_1980}. This mechanism would
also produce transit and occultation timing deviations of the same
sign, while for apsidal precession they would have opposite signs.
For WASP-4, \citet{watson_orbital_2010} estimated that the Applegate
effect could produce timing deviations of up to 15 seconds, depending
on the modulation period of the stellar dynamo.  If this analysis is
accurate, then the Applegate mechanism cannot explain the majority our
observed $82$ second variation.


\explain{The following subsection had material moved into the ``Timing
variation due to line of sight acceleration'' subsection.}
\subsection{Other possible explanations}

\begin{figure*}[t]

		\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{f7.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\vspace{-0.7cm}

    {\bf Further observations will be needed to confirm and understand
    the timing variations of WASP-4b.} \replaced{Dots}{Symbols} are as

    posteriors of the apsidal precession model (orange), and the
    orbital decay model (blue).  \added{The two models may begin to
    diverge in the mid-2020s}.    
		\label{fig:future}
	}
\end{figure*}

There are two \replaced{final}{other} small effects worth noting.  The
first is the \citet{shklovskii_possible_1970} effect due to the star's
proper motion, which leads to an apparent period change of $P\mu^2 d/
c$, which is only $6\times10^{-13}$ for the case of WASP-4.  The
second effect, described by \citet{rafikov_stellar_2009}, comes from
the star's on-sky motion altering our viewing angle, and leads to an
observed apsidal precession. The corresponding period change is
$\dot{P} \sim (P\mu)^2/2\pi$, which is on the order of $10^{-21}$ for
WASP-4, too small to be of any consequence.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Call for additional observations}
\label{sec:future}

A primary purpose of this work has been to call attention to the
timing anomaly of WASP-4 that has been sighted by TESS, and alert
observers to the need for follow-up transit timing, occultation
timing, and radial-velocity monitoring.  There is no unique
interpretation of the current data, and two of the possibilities ---
orbital decay and apsidal precession --- would be of great interest to
confirm. Detection of orbital decay would lead to an unusually direct
determination of a stellar dissipation rate. Detection of apsidal
precession would give a rare constraint on the interior density
distribution of an exoplanet.\added{ The third possibility --- a
massive outer companion --- would be the least exotic option, but
nonetheless a valuable discovery.}

If TESS is extended beyond its primary mission, it will likely observe
additional transits of WASP-4b in the early 2020s
(Figure~\ref{fig:future}).  High-precision transit observations with
larger telescopes would also be useful.  In order to decide between
orbital decay and apsidal precession, occultation measurements in both
the near term and also in the mid-2020s will be needed.  More
radial-velocity data would help in the search for additional bodies
that could be causing dynamical perturbations, or an overall
acceleration of the host star.  The transit duration variations are
expected to be of order 10 seconds \citep{pal_periastron_2008}, and so
may remain out of reach.

TESS will also be monitoring the other known hot Jupiters, which will
reveal whether the timing anomalies seen in WASP-12 and now WASP-4 are
commonplace, and may shed some light on the circumstances in which
they arise. Other wide-field photometric surveys, such as the Next
Generation Transit Survey \citep{wheatley_next_2018}, HATPI
(\href{https://hatpi.org}{hatpi.org}) and PLATO
\citep{rauer_plato_2014} will also extend the time baseline of transit
timing for a large number of systems.

An obvious concern that one might have about the WASP-4\added{b}
timing anomaly is that there might be a systematic offset between the
TESS time system and the time system in which the previous
observations have been reported.  There is a precedent for this type
of error: data from the Kepler mission was afflicted by a systematic
timing error that was corrected only late in the
mission~\citep[][Section 3.4]{kepler_DR19_2013}.

If the observed timing delay in WASP-4b were caused by a systematic
global offset between the TESS time system and the ${\rm BJD}_{\rm
TDB}$ reference, we would expect that it would be apparent in other
hot Jupiter systems, too. It would also be apparent in eclipsing
binary observations and any other periodic phenomena that have been
observed over a long time baseline. Here we examine only hot Jupiters
because of our greater familiarity with the data.

We repeated all the data reduction and analysis steps described in
this paper for other hot Jupiters observed by TESS for which timing
data exists spanning many years.  First, we checked which hot Jupiters
were observed over the first three TESS sectors using a combination of
\texttt{tessmaps}\footnote{\url{github.com/lgbouma/tessmaps}} and
TEPCat \citep{southworth_homogeneous_2011}.  We recalculated the
barycentric corrections using the \citet{eastman_achieving_2010} code,
and found values that agreed with the lightcurve headers to within
about 1 second.  We then selected hot Jupiters for which there were at
least five distinct epochs reported in the peer-reviewed literature.
We required that each observation be of a single transit, that the
midpoint be fit as a free parameter, and that the time system be
clearly documented.  Our final hot Jupiter sample included WASP-4b,
5b, 6b, 18b, and 46b.  The collected and measured times are given in
Tables~5, 6, 7, and 8 for each.

We determined the best-fitting constant-period ephemeris based on the
pre-TESS data. Then we used the parameters and uncertainties in the
best-fitting model to calculate the predicted transit times during
the TESS observation period, as well as the uncertainty in the
predicted times.  The uncertainties are 11, 94, 18, 42, and 59 seconds
for WASP-4b, 5b, 6b, 18b, and 46b, respectively.  By comparing the
observed and predicted times, Figure~\ref{fig:hjs} shows that WASP-4b
is the only hot Jupiter that transited significantly earlier than
expected.

To use these results to place a quantitative limit on any global clock
offset, for each hot Jupiter we considered the model
\begin{equation}
  t_{\rm tra}(E) = t_0 + PE + t_{\rm offset},
\end{equation}
for $t_{\rm offset}$ a systematic constant offset between the reported
timestamps and the true ${\rm BJD}_{\rm TDB}$ reference.  Our priors
were
\begin{align}
  t_0 &\sim \mathcal{N}[t_0', \sigma_{t_0'}], \\
  P &\sim \mathcal{N}[P', \sigma_{P'}], \\
  t_{\rm offset} &\sim \mathcal{U}[-20\sigma_{t_0'},20\sigma_{t_0'}],
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{N}$ and $\mathcal{U}$ denote a normal and uniform
distribution, $(t_0', P')$ are the best-fit reference time and period
using only the pre-TESS transit times, and $(\sigma_{t_0'},
\sigma_{P'})$ are the corresponding uncertainties.

For each planet, we asked: what fraction of the posterior for $t_{\rm
offset}$ is consistent with an offset worse than $81.6$ seconds?  For
WASP-4b, the answer is unsurprisingly 50\%.  For WASP-6b, the most
constraining object, about 1 sample in 2 million is consistent with
such a timing offset ($4.9\sigma$).  For WASP-18b, 1 in 103 samples
would be consistent with this timing offset ($2.3\sigma$), and in
WASP-46b, the limit is 1 in 49 samples ($2.0\sigma$).  For WASP-5b,
the predicted time is too imprecise to rule out timing offsets at the
necessary amplitude.  Multiplying the three independent probabilities
for WASP-5b, 6b, and 18b, we can rule out $t_{\rm offset} < -81.6\
{\rm seconds}$ at $6.4\sigma$, or about about 1 part in 11 billion.

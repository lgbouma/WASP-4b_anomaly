\begin{abstract}
  By combining data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite
  (TESS) with data from previous studies, we show that the transit
  times of WASP-4b are incompatible with a constant orbital period.
  The transits observed by TESS occurred $81.5 \pm 11.8$~seconds
  earlier than one would expect, based on the previous data.  The
  orbital period appears to be shrinking by $\dot{P}=-12.6 \pm 1.2$
  milliseconds per year.   A simple clock offset is unlikely, because
  TESS observations of other hot Jupiters (WASP-6b, 18b, and 46b) are
  compatible with a constant period and rule out a 81.5-second offset
  at the 6.3$\sigma$ level.  The timing variations seem to be
  astrophysical, and could be caused by apsidal precession, or perhaps
  by tidal decay.  The latter seems implausible on theoretical
  grounds, as it would require a stellar quality factor $Q_\star'
  \approx 3\times10^4$.  Apsidal precession would imply an
  eccentricity $e\approx1.8\times 10^{-3}$, and the possibility of
  measuring the planet's Love number.  A Doppler shift from WASP-4's
  acceleration towards us could account for at most one quarter of the
  observed period change (at $2\sigma$).  Further observations are
  needed to confirm and understand the timing variation.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Long-term monitoring of hot Jupiter transit and occultation times
should eventually reveal two distinct processes.  First, whenever the
summed spin and orbital angular momenta in a hot Jupiter system fall
below a critical value, the system becomes unstable to tidal decay
\citep{counselman_outcomes_1973,hut_stability_1980}.  Most hot
Jupiters satisfy this condition; their orbits should be shrinking
\citep{levrard_falling_2009,matsumura_tidal_2010}.  The rate of decay
is uncertain, and depends on how friction dissipates energy carried by
gravitational tides (\citealt{ogilvie_tidal_2014} gives a review).  If
we could directly measure orbital decay rates, it would inform our
understanding of tidal dissipation.  This is important because the
dissipation rates determine the fate of the system.  During its
inspiral, if the planet fills its Roche lobe below the stellar
surface, the drag force from the stellar envelope accelerates the
inspiral, leading to a `direct-impact' merger
\citep{metzger_optical_2012,macleod_planetary_2018} Alternatively, if
the planet fills its Roche lobe above above the stellar surface, then
it could either be disrupted into an accretion disk or it could slowly
transfer mass to the star
\citep{metzger_optical_2012,valsecchi_tidally-driven_2015,jackson_tidal_2016}.
Further afield, the outcome of the eventual interaction between the
Earth and red giant Sun also hinges on the efficiency of tidal
dissipation \citep{rasio_tidal_1996}.

The second process that long-term timing studies should reveal is
apsidal precession, {\it i.e.}, rotation of the orbital ellipse within
the orbital plane. Apsidal precession has been observed extensively in
eclipsing binaries \citep[{\it e.g.},][]{
  schwarzschild_structure_1958,torres_accurate_2010,borkovits_eclipse_2015}
and has been detected in a handful of exoplanet systems, including
circumbinary planets (Kepler-413 \citealt{kostov_kepler-413b_2014};
Kepler-453 \citealt{welsh_kepler_2015}, planets orbiting rapidly
rotating stars (Kepler-13
\citealt{szabo_spin-orbit_2012,szabo_mapping_2014},~\citealt{masuda_spin-orbit_2015};
PTFO 8-8695 \citealt{barnes_measurement_2013}), and systems with
multiple interacting giant planets (Kepler-108
\citealt{mills_kepler-108_2017}; Kepler-693
\citealt{masuda_eccentric_2017}).  Apsidal precession is not regularly
observed in hot Jupiter systems, perhaps in part because their orbits
are nearly circular.  However, there are many mechanisms that could
pump hot Jupiter orbits away from circularity (see
\S~\ref{sec:apsidal_precession}, and
\citealt{bailey_understanding_2019}), which would then lead to
observable timing variations.  For hot Jupiters, the apsidal
precession is usually dominated by the quadrupolar distortion of the
planet by the star's tidal force \citep{ragozzine_probing_2009}.  The
observed precession rate in a hot Jupiter system could thus be used to
compute the planet's Love number, giving a third parameter along with
the mass and radius with which to describe the planet's interior
structure \citep[{\it e.g.},][who performed a similar procedure for
HAT-P-13b]{batygin_determination_2009}.  Measuring small
eccentricities and understanding their origin might also help us
understand the dynamical histories and inflated radii of hot Jupiters.
\citep[{\it
e.g.},][respectively]{dawson_origins_2018,ibgui_tidal_2010}

While numerous indirect studies have called attention to
population-level effects of tidal decay
\citep{jackson_observational_2009,hansen_calibration_2010,penev_constraining_2012,husnoo_observational_2012,matsakos_origin_2016,cameron_hierarchical_2018,penev_empirical_2018},
the most convincing direct evidence to date for either orbital decay
or apsidal precession has come from WASP-12b.
\citet{maciejewski_departure_2016} showed that the transit times of
WASP-12b did not follow a linear ephemeris at $5\sigma$ confidence,
and measured $\dot{P} = -26 \pm 4\,{\rm ms}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$.  Using
new timing data, \citet{patra_2017} found $\dot{P} = -29 \pm 3\,{\rm
ms}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$.  If the period change were caused entirely by
tidal decay, the implied modified stellar quality factor would be
$Q_\star' \approx 2\times10^5$.  Standard equilibrium tides do not
predict this level of dissipation
\citep{penev_tidal_2011,ogilvie_tidal_2014}.  The needed level of
friction might come from dynamical tides, or obliquity tides
\citep{weinberg_tidal_2017,millholland_obliquity_2018}.  The former is
more likely if WASP-12 is a subgiant, but the observational
constraints favor a main-sequence model
\citep{bailey_understanding_2019}.  More data are needed to understand
the WASP-12b timing variations.

This work focuses on the hot Jupiter WASP-4b, which orbits its host
star every 1.34 days, at a distance of $a/R_\star = 5.46$
\citep{wilson_wasp-4b_2008,hoyer_tramos_2013}.  WASP-4b is a plausible
candidate for orbital decay, and has been
observed often over the past decade.  The host is a G7V dwarf, and is on the
main sequence (\S~\ref{sec:system_parameters}).  The orbit is
consistent with being circular (but see
\S~\ref{sec:apsidal_precession}), and having sky-projected obliquity
of zero
\citep{triaud_spin-orbit_2010,beerer_secondary_2011,sanchis-ojeda_starspots_2011}.

We measure new transit times for WASP-4b using TESS lightcurves
(\S~\ref{sec:observations},~\ref{sec:measurement}), and calculate the
system's parameters empirically (\S~\ref{sec:system_parameters}).  We
merge the new times with previous observations and compare three
models (\S~\ref{sec:timing}): a constant period, a decaying period,
and a slightly eccentric orbit undergoing precession.  We rule out a
constant period, but cannot firmly distinguish between the latter two
possibilities.  Each would have interesting implications
(\S~\ref{sec:implications}).  We rule out the possibility that a
systematic time system offset causes the observed variation
(Appendix~\ref{sec:verify_tess}), and conclude by advocating for
further monitoring of the system (\S~\ref{sec:future}).

\subsection{Observations}
\label{sec:observations}

WASP-4 was observed in TESS camera 2 from August 23, 2018 to September
20, during the spacecraft's second sector of science operations.  The
star is designated by the TESS Input Catalog as TIC 402026209
\citep{stassun_TIC_2018}.

The TESS spacecraft recorded images of WASP-4 in an $11\times11$ pixel
array every 2 minutes.   The data were downlinked via the Deep Space
Network. The timestamps from the spacecraft clock were then converted
by the Payload Operations Center to TESS Julian Day in the {\it
Temps Dynamique Barycentrique} (TDB) reference.  The images were then
reduced to lightcurves by the Science Processing Operations Center (SPOC)
at NASA Ames~\citep{jenkins_tess_2016}.  During this processing, SPOC used
the known
spacecraft trajectory to compute the barycentric time corrections on a
target by target basis, and reported timestamps in ``BTJD'', where
${\rm BTJD} = {\rm BJD} - 2457000$, BJD is the barycentric julian
date, and all times are in the TDB reference (\citealt{urban_explanatory_2012} 
describe the relevant time systems).
The lightcurves were then vetted and released by the MIT TESS Science
Office to the Mikulski Archive for Space
Telescopes~\citep{ricker_tess_alerts_2018}.

We began our analysis with the Presearch Data Conditioning (PDC) light
curves from MAST.  The steps used to find an optimal aperture (for
WASP-4, a $3\times 3$ pixel array) and the PDC-MAP algorithm are
described by \citet{smith_kepler_apertures_2017} and
\citet{smith_kepler_PDC_2017} respectively.

We processed the lightcurve as follows.  First, we removed all
points with non-zero quality flags.  This removed data contaminated by
coarse spacecraft pointing, cosmic rays, and other annoyances
\citep{tess_data_product_description_2018}.  We then filtered out
known bad observing windows.  The data closest to spacecraft perigee
typically show ramp-like systematics, so we clipped out the first and
last hour of both orbits.  Next, we focused on the momentum dumps. As
described in the data release
notes\footnote{\url{archive.stsci.edu/hlsps/tess-data-alerts/hlsp_tess-data-alerts_tess_phot_s01_tess_v1_release-notes.pdf}},
during the first two TESS sectors, every 2.5~days the spacecraft's
reaction wheels were reset to maintain pointing stability.  These
events were assigned quality flags corresponding to ``Reaction Wheel
Desaturation Event'' and ``Manual Exclude''.  For WASP-4, these flags
were simultaneously set for 54 distinct cadences, and there were 10
momentum dumps, averaging about 10 minutes of flagged data per dump.
Simply out of caution, we clipped out an additional 10 minutes before
and after every momentum dump.  Before applying any filters, we had
19737 data points. After applying all the filters, we were left with
18165 measurements, or 92\% of the original data.

After ``cleaning'' the data, we normalized the flux measurements by
dividing out the median flux.  We converted the timestamps from BTJD
to BJD by adding the appropriate 2457000 day offset
\citep{tess_data_product_description_2018}.  Many of these and
subsequent processing steps were performed using
\texttt{astrobase}~\citep{bhatti_astrobase_2018} We did not
``flatten'' the lightcurves, as is often done with {\it
e.g.}, a spline or gaussian process regression.  Such procedures are
asymmetric about the transit minimum and can skew the midtime
measurement without being captured by the measurement uncertainties.



\subsection{Measuring the transit times}
\label{sec:measurement}

\begin{figure}[t]

    \vspace{-0.6cm}
    \caption{
        {\bf TESS saw WASP-4b transit earlier than expected.} Both
        plots show observed transit times minus the pre-TESS ephemeris
        as a function of transit number.  Blue curves are the $\pm
        1\sigma$ credible interval around the constant-period
        prediction.  {\it Top:} The full timing dataset spans 10
        years.  Less precise points are more transparent.  {\it
        Bottom:} The binned TESS observation (red band) arrived $81.5
        \pm 11.8\ {\rm seconds}$ before it was expected.
        \label{fig:arrived_early}
    }
\end{figure}

Using the cleaned PDC lightcurve, we ran Box Least Squares (BLS) to
estimate the orbital period, transit duration and a reference epoch
\citep{kovacs_box-fitting_2002}.  From these parameters, we isolated
each transit to within $\pm$4 transit durations of its midtime.  We
then fit the phase-folded transit, using the analytic formulae
calculated by \citet{mandel_analytic_2002} and implemented by
\citet{kreidberg_batman_2015}.  Specifically, we fit for a reference
epoch, the planet to star radius ratio $R_{\rm p}/R_\star$, the
semi-major axis to stellar radius ratio $a/R_\star$, the inclination
$i$, two quadratic limb-darkening coefficients $(u_{\rm linear},
u_{\rm quad})$, and the orbital period $P$.  We set the eccentricity
to zero. 

Having defined the free and fixed parameters, we sampled over the
posterior using the algorithm proposed by
\citet{goodman_ensemble_2010} and implemented by
\citet{foreman-mackey_emcee_2013}.  Table~1 gives the results, which
are in reasonable agreement with the parameters reported by {\it
e.g.}, \citet{southworth_high-precision_2009} and
\citet{huitson_gemini_2017}.
Figure~\ref{fig:phasefold} shows the phase-folded lightcurve.

To measure the transit midtimes, we then fit  each individual transit
for a model transit, plus a local linear trend.  We allowed four free 
parameters per transit: the time of
mid-transit $t_{\rm tra}$, the planet-to-star radius ratio, and the
slope and intercept of the line.  We fixed the remaining
parameters%~---~$a/R_\star$, $i$, $P$, and the limb-darkening
%coefficients~---~
to the best-fit values determined from the
phase-folded TESS lightcurve.

After completing an initial fit for each transit, we set the
photometric error bars to equal the standard deviation of the
out-of-transit points of the residual lightcurve.  We then repeated
the fitting procedure, using the empirically determined photometric
errors.

To verify that the measured uncertainties are plausible, we computed
the reduced $\chi^2$ for a linear ephemeris fit to the measured TESS
transit times.  We found that $\chi^2 = 9.2$, with 16 degrees of
freedom.  Visually inspecting residuals showed that the error variance
had been overestimated, so we multiplied the measured TESS errors by a
factor $f=0.76$, forcing a reduced $\chi^2$ of unity.  This lowered
the mean uncertainty of the transit midtimes from $29.8$ to $22.6$
seconds.

Figure~\ref{fig:lightcurves} shows the lightcurve of each transit, the
best-fit models, and the residuals.  Table~2 reports the mid-transit
times and their uncertainties.
Binning the residuals to 1-hour windows and taking the median absolute
deviation, the lightcurves have an RMS of $586\,{\rm ppm}\,{\rm
hr}^{1/2}$.  The predicted\footnote{\url{github.com/lgbouma/tnm}}
photon-counting noise is $410\,{\rm ppm}\,{\rm hr}^{1/2}$.  For a
$T\approx11.8$ star with a 9-pixel aperture, read noise is expected to
contribute an additional $202\,{\rm ppm}\,{\rm hr}^{1/2}$ in
quadrature.  The predicted zodiacal background contribution is
$673\,{\rm ppm}\,{\rm hr}^{1/2}$, based on the
\citet{winn_photonflux_2013} model, which \citet{Sullivan_2015} used
in planet detection simulations.  This zodiacal noise prediction seems
to have been an overestimate, given the observed RMS of WASP-4.  A
broader assessment of TESS's photometric performance is beyond
the scope of this work.

\citet{doyle_accurate_2013} found accurate spectroscopic parameters
for WASP-4 using high S/N HARPS spectra.  Using their (T$_{\rm eff}$,
$\log g$, $[{\rm Fe/H}]$) and the available {\it Gaia} parallaxes, we
calculate the remaining system parameters empirically.

We compute the bolometric flux using broadband magnitudes from
available all-sky catalogs, as follows: $G$ from {\it Gaia\/} DR2,
$B_T V_T$ from {\it Tycho-2}, $BVgri$ from {\it APASS}, $JHK_S$ from {\it
2MASS}, and the {\it WISE}~1--4 passbands, thus spanning the
wavelength range 0.4--22~$\mu$m.  Combining the implied angular radius
with the {\it Gaia} DR2 parallax, and adjusting for the parallax
offset \citep{stassun_evidence_2018}, we obtain the stellar radius.
For the stellar mass, we started with the $a/R_\star$ value found from
the phase-folded TESS lightcurve.  The implied stellar density follows
\citep{seager_unique_2003}, as do the
semi-major axis and stellar mass.  We get the planet radius using our
$R_{\rm p}/R_\star$ measurement.  Finally, for the planet mass we use the
inclination angle from the transit, and the RV semi-amplitude from 
\citet{triaud_spin-orbit_2010}.

We list the resulting parameters in Table~1, and adopt them for the
remaining analysis.  Our parameters broadly agree with those of previous
authors
\citep{wilson_wasp-4b_2008,gillon_discovery_2009,winn_transit_2009,southworth_homogeneous_2011,petrucci_no_2013}.
% The sole exception is that our measured $R_{\rm p}/R_\star$ value is
% slightly smaller than most ground-based measurements (see Tables 2 and
% 3 of \citealt{hoyer_tramos_2013}).  However, looking at the I-band
% measurements of \citet{hoyer_tramos_2013} and taking the mean + std
% deviation, it's a ~1 sigma effect. So I won't mention it!
Comparing our empirical result with the Yonsei-Yale evolutionary track
predicted by the spectroscopic parameters, we see that WASP-4 has an
age $\approx 7\,{\rm Gyr}$, and is securely in the main-sequence stage
of evolution.

        \label{fig:times}
    }
\end{figure*}

Table~1 shows the transit times we used in our analysis.  We included
data from peer-reviewed literature for which the analysis was based on
observations of a single, complete transit, and for which the midpoint
was fit as a free parameter. We also required that the time system be
clearly documented.  The occultation times are in Table~3.  There are
fewer available, so we included all the occultation measurements we
could find. The tabulated values have been corrected for the
light-travel time across the diameter of the orbit by subtracting
$2a/c = 22.8$ seconds from the observed time.

We used the homogeneous \citet{hoyer_tramos_2013} timing study as our
starting point\footnote{We also tried taking times directly from the
references listed in Table~2; the results did not change, so we opted
for the homogeneously determined \citet{hoyer_tramos_2013} times.}.
Though their latest two epochs fell slightly below the prediction of a
linear ephemeris (Panel C of their Figure~6), they did not find a need
to fit a quadratic function to the O-C values.  We verified that all
times were on the BJD$_{\rm TDB}$ time standard using the
\citet{eastman_achieving_2010} calculator.  We set the zero-point
epoch to be as close as possible to the average of the midtimes,
weighted as the inverse midtime variance. This lowered the
covariance between the transit epoch and the period
\citep{gibson_gemini_2013}.

Important contributions to the timing dataset were as follows.  Our
earliest epoch was from EulerCam on the 1.2-m Euler telescope
\citep{wilson_wasp-4b_2008}.  The second epoch came from $z$-band
photometry acquired by \citet{gillon_improved_2009} at the VLT 8.2-m
with FORS2.  We included subsequent transits from
\citet{winn_transit_2009}\footnote{\citet{winn_transit_2009} recorded
the GPS clock time in UT reference. They then converted this to BJD in
the TDB reference for their reported midtimes.},
\citet{dragomir_terms_2011}, \citet{sanchis-ojeda_starspots_2011},
\citet{nikolov_wasp-4b_2012}, \citet{hoyer_tramos_2013}, and
\citet{ranjan_atmospheric_2014}.  Finally, \citet{huitson_gemini_2017}
acquired optical transmission spectra with the 8.1-m Gemini South
telescope over 2011 to 2014, one transit per season.  The per-point
standard deviation of their lightcurves was a few hundred parts per
million, within a factor of 3 from the photon noise limit.  The
precision on their reported midtimes averaged 5.6~seconds. Though
extremely precise, this was possible given the quality of their
data~\citep{carter_analytic_2008}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\citet{winn_transit_2009} measured two transits with the Baade 6.5-m
%at Las Campanas\footnote{\citet{winn_transit_2009} recorded the GPS
%clock time in UT reference. They then converted this to BJD in the
%TDB reference for their reported midtimes.}, and reported transit
%midtimes precise to 6~seconds.  \citet{dragomir_terms_2011} updated
%the ephemeris using two transits measured with the CTIO 0.9-m and
%1.0-m.  \citet{sanchis-ojeda_starspots_2011} reported four more
%transits from the Baade telescope at Las Campanas\footnote{
%\citet{sanchis-ojeda_starspots_2011} also used starspot occultations
%to show that the star's rotation axis is nearly aligned with the
%planet's orbital axis, in agreement with the Rossiter-McLaughlin
%measurement by \citet{triaud_spin-orbit_2010}.}.
%\citet{nikolov_wasp-4b_2012} observed 3 transits, in 4 independent
%photometry bands (Sloan {\it g'}, {\it r'}, {\it i'}, {\it z'}) with
%the MPG/EOS-2.2~m at La Silla.  \citet{hoyer_tramos_2013} reported
%nine transit observations taken with the the Y4KCAM on the SMARTS 1-m
%telescope, and another three with the SOI on the SOAR 4.2-m
%telescope.  \citet{hoyer_tramos_2013} also homogeneously redetermined
%the transit times from all previous studies.  After the study by
%\citet{hoyer_tramos_2013}, \citet{ranjan_atmospheric_2014} acquired
%near-IR spectra of WASP-4b using HST's WFC3 in both transit and
%secondary eclipse.  We adopt only their transit time, since the epoch
%of occultation was not fit as a free parameter.'

% There have been other studies of WASP-4b for which the transit
% timing data are either hetereogenous, not available, or not useable.
% We omitted the timing measurements from
% \citet{southworth_high-precision_2009}, since there were technical
% problems with the computer clock at the time of
% observation~\citep{nikolov_wasp-4b_2012}.  The timing study
% by~\citet{petrucci_no_2013} ruled out transit timing variations
% larger than 54~seconds over the previous 5 years, but did not report
% transit times.  \citet{baluev_benchmarking_2015} collected transit
% times for many hot Jupiters, including WASP-4b, and included times
% from the Exoplanet Transit Database
% (ETD)\footnote{\url{http://var2.astro.cz/ETD/}}
% \citep{poddany_ETD_2010}.  Since the ETD data come from
% heterogeneous sources, their timestamps are less clearly documented,
% and the times are thus more prone to systematic errors, we omit them
% from consideration.  %We consider the effects of including ETD data
% in %Appendix~\ref{sec:verify_archival_times}.
% \citet{may_mopss_2018} obtained optical spectra using IMCAS on
% Magellan, and found a flat transmission spectrum, in agreement with
% the results reported by \citet{huitson_gemini_2017}.  They did not
% report transit times.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

There were fewer available occultation times.
\citet{beerer_secondary_2011} observed two occultations of WASP-4b
using warm Spitzer in the 3.6\,$\mu$m and 4.5\,$\mu$m bands.
\citet{caceres_ground-based_2011} detected an occultation from the
ground in the $K_S$ band, and gave a time in HJD, without specifying
the time standard.  We assumed the standard was UTC, and verified that
assuming TDB did not alter any of our conclusions.
%Finally, as previously mentioned, \citet{ranjan_atmospheric_2014}
%acquired occultation data with HST but kept the epoch as a fixed
%parameter.
Finally, \citet{zhou_secondary_2015} acquired occultation data from
the Anglo-Australian Telescope, focusing on the eclipse depth, but
also fitting for $e\cos\omega$.  We converted their reported
$e\cos\omega$ to a midtime, using their ephemeris and the standard
formula \citep[{\it e.g.},][]{winn_exoplanet_2010}
\begin{equation}
  t_{\rm occ}(E) =
  t_0 +  P E  +
  \frac{P}{2} \left( 1 + \frac{4}{\pi} e\cos\omega \right).
  \label{eq:occultation_time}
\end{equation}
In total, we had four occultations.  Although the occultation times
were less precise than the transit times, they nonetheless helped 
modeling the timing variations.


\subsection{Analysis}

After collecting the literature times and measuring the TESS times, we
compared the observed time to the prediction based solely on the
literature times. The result is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:arrived_early}. The TESS observations 
arrived early.  
Simply out of caution, we were immediately concerned about systematic
errors in either the archival or the TESS timestamps. The tests we
used to mitigate the latter possibility are described in
Appendix~\ref{sec:verify_tess}. Checks against systematic errors in
the pre-TESS times are discussed below.

Assuming that the observed timing variation is astrophysical, we
proceeded by exploring three models for the timing data, identical to
the study by~\citet{patra_2017}.  

The first model assumes a constant orbital period on a circular orbit:
\begin{align}
  t_{\rm tra}(E) &= t_0 + PE,\\
  t_{\rm occ}(E) &= t_0 + \frac{P}{2} + PE,
\end{align}
for $E$ the epoch number.
The two free parameters are the reference epoch $t_0$ and the period $P$.

The second model assumes a constant period derivative, and a circular
orbit:
\begin{align}
  t_{\rm tra}(E) &=
    t_0 + PE +
    \frac{1}{2} \frac{{\rm d}P}{{\rm d}E} E^2, \\
  t_{\rm occ}(E) &=
    t_0 + \frac{P}{2} + PE +
    \frac{1}{2} \frac{{\rm d}P}{{\rm d}E} E^2.
\end{align}
The three free parameters are the epoch, period at the reference epoch,
and period derivative, ${\rm d}P/{\rm d}t = (1/P) {\rm d}P/{\rm d}E$. 

The third model assumes the planet has a slightly eccentric orbit, and
that the line of apsides is rotating:
\begin{align}
  t_{\rm tra}(E) &= 
		t_0 + P_{\rm s}E
    - \frac{e P_{\rm a}}{\pi} \cos\omega,\\
  t_{\rm occ}(E) &= 
    t_0 + \frac{P_{\rm a}}{2} + P_{\rm s}E
    + \frac{e P_{\rm a}}{\pi} \cos\omega,
\end{align}
for $P_{\rm s}$ the sidereal period, $e$ the eccentricity, $P_{\rm a}$
the anomalistic period, and $\omega$ the argument of pericenter.
Following~\citet{gimenez_revision_1995} and~\citet{patra_2017}, in
this model the angular velocity of the line of apsides ${\rm
d}\omega/{\rm d}E$ is constant,
\begin{equation}
  \omega(E) = \omega_0 + \frac{{\rm d}\omega}{{\rm d}E} E,
\end{equation}
and the sidereal and anomalistic periods are related by
\begin{equation}
  P_{\rm s} = P_{\rm a} \left(
    1 - \frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{{\rm d}\omega}{{\rm d}E}
    \right).
\end{equation}
The five free parameters are the epoch, sidereal period, eccentricity,
argument of pericenter at the reference epoch, and angular velocity of
line of apsides:
$(t_0, P_{\rm s}, e, \omega_0, {\rm d}\omega/{\rm d}E)$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Assuming the error bars on the transit midtimes are gaussian and
% independent, we then proceed by fitting each model to the timing data.
% For the linear model, we took uniform priors over small windows around
% the expected parameters.  For the quadratic model we did the same, and
% took the quadratic term to have a uniform prior corresponding to
% $
%   Q_\star' \sim \mathcal{U}[10^3, 10^9],
% $
% for $Q_\star'$ the modified quality factor defined in
% \S~\ref{sec:implications}.  For the precession model, we took the same
% priors in epoch and sidereal period, and drew the remaining parameters
% from wide uniform distributions.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%TODO: final numbers
Figure~\ref{fig:times} shows the residuals with respect to the linear
model.  The best linear fit has $\chi^2 = 174$ and 61 degrees of
freedom.  The best quadratic fit has $\chi^2 = 62.6$ and 60
degrees of freedom, compared to $\chi^2 = 64.4$
and 58 degrees of freedom for the best-fit precession model.

%TODO: final numbers. note epoch changes...
The difference in $\chi^2$ between the linear and quadratic fit
corresponds to $p \approx 10^{-26}$.  A more likely possibility is
clearly that a systematic error is affecting one of the most important
sets of times: either the earliest times, the Huitson et al.\ Gemini
times (epoch numbers 30, 308, 577, and 837), or the TESS times.  We
have taken every precaution against systematic offsets in the TESS
times (Appendix~\ref{sec:verify_tess}), and Huitson et al.\ stand by
their reported times (J.-M. D\'esert, priv.\
comm.)\footnote{\citet{huitson_gemini_2017} corrected the times to be
at mid-exposure. They also analyzed other hot Jupiters, which all
showed mid-transit times as expected from a constant ephemeris.
The two Spitzer transits at epochs 362 and 365 are in independent
agreement with the Gemini times.}.
Since the linear model provides a poor fit to the data, we discard it
from further consideration.

The quadratic model provides a slightly better fit to the data than the
precession model.  It is favored by $\Delta \chi^2 = 1.8$, and has two
fewer free parameters.  Another useful heuristic for model comparison
is the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC),
\begin{equation}
  {\rm BIC} = \chi^2 + k\log n,
\end{equation}
for $k$ the number of free parameters, and $n$ the number of data
points. For us, $n=62$.  The difference in the BIC for the precession
and decay models is $\Delta {\rm BIC} = {\rm BIC}_{\rm prec} - {\rm
BIC}_{\rm quad} = 10$, corrsonding to a Bayes factor $\approx
1.2\times10^{4}$.  The Akaike Information Criterion similarly favors
the orbital decay model, by $\Delta {\rm AIC} = 5.8$.  This is strong
evidence that the quadratic model describes the data better than the
precession model \citep{kass_bayes_1995}.

If we assume the orbital decay model, we find a period derivative 
\begin{equation}
\dot{P}
  = - (3.98 \pm 0.38)\times 10^{-10}
  = - (12.6) \pm 1.2\,{\rm ms}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}.
  \label{eq:dP_dt_obs}
\end{equation}
For comparison, the period derivative seen by
\citet{maciejewski_departure_2016} and \citet{patra_2017} in WASP-12b
is $\dot{P} = -29 \pm 3\,{\rm ms}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$.  If both planets
are decaying, WASP-4b would be inspiraling at about half the rate as
WASP-12b.

If we instead assume the precession model, the best-fit eccentricity
is
\begin{equation}
  e = (1.83^{+ 1.88}_{- 0.75})\times10^{-3}
\end{equation}
The longitude of periapse correspondingly advances by $\dot{\omega} =
14.0^{+4.9}_{-3.5}\ {\rm degrees}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, and the precession
period is $26^{+9}_{-7}$ years.

The median parameters and their 68\% confidence intervals are reported
for the three models in Table~4.  In short, a linear ephemeris does
not describe the observed times.  Both orbital decay and precession
can fit the data, but the precession model is statistically
disfavored.

    \label{fig:context}
  }
\end{figure}

 
\subsection{Orbital decay}

The middle panel of Figure~\ref{fig:context} shows the expected
orbital decay time of WASP-4b compared to other transiting giant
planets.  Although roughly 20 hot Jupiters have shorter predicted
orbital decay times than WASP-4b, most have shorter observing
baselines.  A separate consideration is that some hot Jupiter host
stars ({\it e.g.}, WASP-18) are fully radiative, and may dissipate
tidal energy less efficiently than stars with convective zones, like
WASP-4.

For the sake of argument, let us assume that the timing variation is
caused entirely by orbital decay.  If the orbital period decreases
at a fixed rate, then it will reach zero after
\begin{equation}
  \frac{P}{ \dot{P} } = 9.2 \, {\rm Myr}.
\end{equation}
For comparison, the survival time found by \citet{patra_2017} for
WASP-12b was 3.2\,Myr.

Let us further assume that the ``constant phase lag'' model for tidal
interaction in a binary applies \citep{zahn_tidal_1977}.  The star's
response to tidal forcing is parametrized by a modified\footnote{For
stars, $k_\star \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$, so it is important to
explicitly distinguish $Q_\star'$ from $Q_\star$ \citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{schwarzschild_structure_1958}.} quality factor, $Q_\star' =
3 Q_\star / (2k_\star)$.  Here $k_\star$ is the stellar Love number,
which is smaller when the star's density distribution is more
centrally concentrated. $Q_\star$ is the ratio between the energy
stored in the equilibrium deformation of the star and the energy lost
to heat per tidal period \citep[{\it e.g.},][]{goldreich_q_1966}.  A
larger $Q_\star$ implies less efficient tidal dissipiation.  Though
the fluid mechanics responsible for the dissipation should depend on
the amplitude and frequency of the tidal perturbation
\citep[][Section~3.3]{ogilvie_tidal_2014}, we will treat $Q_\star'$ as
a constant.  This should not be taken literally; $Q_\star'$ may in
fact change sharply as the tidal frequency changes
\citep{penev_empirical_2018}.

If the planet's spin and orbit are synchronized and the star is slowly
rotating, the semi-major axis and eccentricity then evolve as
\citep[Appendix B of][]{metzger_optical_2012}
\begin{align}
  \frac{1}{\tau_{\rm e}} &=
  \frac{|\dot{e}|}{e} =
    \frac{63 \pi } {2 Q_{\rm p}' }
    \left( \frac{R_{\rm p}}{a} \right)^5
    \left( \frac{M_\star}{M_{\rm p}} \right)
    \left( \frac{1}{P} \right)
  \label{eq:de_dt}
  \\
  \frac{1}{\tau_{\rm a}} &=
  \frac{|\dot{a}|}{a} =
    \frac{9 \pi } {Q_\star' }
    \left( \frac{R_\star}{a} \right)^5
    \left( \frac{M_{\rm p}}{M_\star} \right)
    \left( \frac{1}{P} \right).
  \label{eq:da_dt}
\end{align}
The orbital period evolves as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dP_dt}
  \dot{P} = -\frac{27\pi}{2 Q_\star'}
            \left(\frac{M_{\rm p}}{M_\star}\right)
            \left(\frac{R_\star}{a}\right)^5.
\end{equation}
The modified quality factor of WASP-4 corresponding to the observed
value of $\dot{P}$ is then
\begin{equation}
	Q_\star' \approx 2.9\times10^4,
\end{equation}
which is rather small.  Jupiter has $Q_{\rm Jup}' \approx 1.4 \times
10^5$, based on the orbits of the Galilean moons
\citep{lainey_strong_2009}.  For stars, studies of the binary
eccentricity distribution have found $Q_\star' \approx 10^5 - 10^7$
\citep[{\it e.g.},][]{meibom_robust_2005,belczynski_compact_2008,
geller_direct_2013,milliman_wiyn_2014}.  The dissipation rates may
differ in hot Jupiter systems, since the tidal forcing frequencies and
amplitudes are different.  Observationally-driven studies of hot
Jupiter systems have found $Q_\star' \approx 10^5 - 10^8$, from quite
different models
\citep{jackson_observational_2009,hansen_calibration_2010,penev_constraining_2012,penev_empirical_2018,cameron_hierarchical_2018}.
For instance, motivated by the rapid rotation of some hot Jupiter
hosts \citep{pont_empirical_2009,penev_hats-18b_2016},
\citet{penev_empirical_2018} modeled the evolution of hot Jupiter
systems under the influence of a magnetized wind and a constant
phase-lag tide.  For WASP-4, their method gave $Q_\star' \approx
(1.2^{+1.0}_{-0.5})\times10^7$.  This strongly disagrees with the
quality factor we infer from the apparent period change.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% In fact, for the observed population of hot Jupiters,
% \citet{penev_constraining_2012} argued that $Q_\star' > 10^7$ would
% be required at some phase of hot Jupiter evolution at the 99\%
% level, or else the observed population would not exist (though
% \citealt{birkby_wts-2_2014} point out more efficient dissipation
% would be allowed if the hot Jupiters arrived later).  Developing a
% generative model for the orbital separation distribution of the hot
% Jupiter population, \citet{cameron_hierarchical_2018} similarly
% found $10^7 \gtrsim Q_\star' \gtrsim 10^8$.

% Using an empirical approach, \citet{penev_empirical_2018} reported a
% $Q_\star'$ measurement for WASP-4.  In earlier work,
% \citet{penev_hats-18b_2016} noted that HATS-18b and WASP-19b orbited
% host stars whose isochronal ages are consistent with the Sun, but
% whose stellar rotation periods are about 10 days
% (\citealt{pont_empirical_2009} pointed out similar evidence for hot
% Jupiter host spin-up).  The expected rotation periods at solar ages
% are 20 to 30 days
% (\citealt{schatzman_theory_1962,skumanich_time_1972}, and
% measurements by \citealt{barnes_rotation_2016} in the 4\,Gyr-old M67
% cluster).  Assuming that the difference between the observed and
% predicted stellar rotation period was due to tides depositing
% angular momentum in the star, \citet{penev_empirical_2018} modeled
% the evolution of hot Jupiter systems under the influence of a
% magnetized wind and a constant phase-lag tide.  They found two-sided
% limits for $Q_\star'$ in 35 of the 188 systems they examined.  In
% these 35 systems, they found that $Q_\star'$ varied from $10^5$ at
% tidal periods of 2 days to $10^7$ at tidal periods of 0.5 days.  For
% WASP-4 specifically, their method gave $Q_\star' \approx
% (1.2^{+1.0}_{-0.5})\times10^7$. This is more than 2 orders of
% magnitude less efficient than the dissipation rate inferred from the
% decaying orbit would imply.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\citet{essick_orbital_2016} proposed a theoretically-motivated tidal
dissipation model , in which a coupled network of gravity modes is
excited at the base of the stellar convective zone, and brakes near
the stellar core to provide the needed dissipation.  In their
approach, the stellar quality factors in hot Jupiter systems vary from
$Q_\star' \approx 10^5 - 10^6$.  From their Equation 26, the
prediction for WASP-4 is $Q_\star' = 7\times10^5$.  This is an order
of magnitude larger than implied by the observed period change.

The applicability of the \citet{essick_orbital_2016} model depends on
the evolutionary state of the star.  The bottom panel of
Figure~\ref{fig:context} shows WASP-4 in the context of giant planet
hosts from the \citet{bonomo_gaps_2017} sample.  On the y-axis is
$G=g-\mu$, for $g$ the apparent Gaia-band magnitude, and $\mu$ the
distance modulus reported by \citet{gaia_collaboration_gaia_2018}.
The x-axis is the effective temperature from \citet{bonomo_gaps_2017},
which for WASP-4 agrees within $1\sigma$ of that from Table~1.
Inspecting the HR diagram, WASP-4 shows little evidence of being
evolved, in agreement with our analysis from
\S~\ref{sec:system_parameters}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% By a similar argument though, WASP-12 would not clearly stand out as a
% candidate subgiant, and \citet{weinberg_tidal_2017} suggest it may in
% fact be a subgiant (though \citealt{bailey_understanding_2019} do not
% find evidence that supports this suggestion).  A more thorough
% isochronal analysis would be of interest, particularly if the transit
% and occultation times continue to vary.  Such an analysis is beyond
% the scope of this study.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To summarize, if the observed period change is caused entirely by
tidal decay, then the implied stellar tidal dissipation efficiency
would be stronger than expected.  It might be possible that we are
observing at a special time, shortly after the planet's inward
migration, or when the planet is near resonance with a stellar
oscillation mode.  Tidal dissipation rates might also be increased if
the star is turning off the main sequence.  A final possibility is
that an exterior planet could be trapping WASP-4b's spin vector in a
high-obliquity state, causing planetary obliquity tides as suggested
for WASP-12b \citep{millholland_obliquity_2018}.  For now, all of
these explanations seem strained; it is unclear that tidal decay can
explain the observed timing variations by any mechanism that we have
considered.


\subsection{Apsidal precession}
\label{sec:apsidal_precession}

Let us instead assume that the timing variation is a portion of an
apsidal precession cycle.  The required orbital eccentricity is then
$e\approx 1.8\times10^{-3}$, and one full precession period would take
about 24 years.

\citet{ragozzine_probing_2009} calculated apsidal precession periods
for hot Jupiters ranging between $\approx$10--100 years.  They
highlighted that for many hot Jupiters, including WASP-4b, over 90\%
of the apsidal precession comes from the tidal bulge of the planet.
Precession from general relativity, the planet's rotational bulge, and
the star's rotational and tidal bulges are minor additions.
%\citet{ragozzine_probing_2009} also calcuated that WASP-4b was expected
%to have a relatively short precession period, of 120 years.

\citet{ragozzine_probing_2009} also noted that if the planet has
non-zero eccentricity, a measurement of $\dot{\omega}$ can be used to
measure the planet's Love number.  From their Equation 14, the implied
Love number for WASP-4b is
\begin{equation}
k_{2,{\rm p}} = 1.5^{+2.1}_{-1.1}.
\end{equation}
For comparison, $k_{2,{\rm Jup}} \approx 0.55$
\citep{wahl_tidal_2016,ni_empirical_2018}.  A uniform density sphere
has $k_2 = 1.5$.  Our uncertainties on $k_{2,{\rm p}}$ are large
because the eccentricity, reference time, and ${\rm d}\omega/{\rm d}E$
are correlated, and the measured occultation times only barely
constrain them (Figure~\ref{fig:future}).

\subsubsection{Observations of small eccentricities in hot
Jupiter systems}

Could the eccentricity truly be non-zero?  For WASP-4b, the
eccentricity damping timescale (Equation~\ref{eq:de_dt}) is $\tau_e =
0.30 (Q_{\rm p}'/10^5) \, {\rm Myr}$.  The system is well over
$1\,{\rm Gyr}$ old, so unless the planet arrived very recently, any
initial eccentricity should have been erased.

The top panel of Figure~\ref{fig:context} compares the expected
eccentricity damping time of WASP-4b with other transiting giant
planets.  WASP-4b has one of the shortest known eccentricity damping
times.  The hot Jupiter with the nearest $\tau_e$ and a significant
measured eccentricity is WASP-18b, with $e = 0.0076 \pm 0.0010$
\citep{triaud_spin-orbit_2010,bonomo_gaps_2017}.  This is the smallest
significant eccentricity measured by the RV method, with the
next-smallest cases being HAT-P-20b ($e =
0.01580^{+0.0023}_{-0.0018}$), and WASP-38b ($e =
0.02780^{+0.003}_{-0.0028}$).
% For the 231 planets studied by \citet{bonomo_gaps_2017}, 2 (13) had
% $2\sigma$ upper limits of $e < 0.01$ ($e<0.02$).  For WASP-4b, the
% strongest $2\sigma$ upper-limit on its eccentricity from RVs is
% $e<0.011$ \citep{husnoo_observational_2012,bonomo_gaps_2017}.  

Occultation timing can provide stronger eccentricity limits than RV
measurements, but they often come with caveats.  For WASP-4b, the
strongest limit on its eccentricity comes from
\citet{beerer_secondary_2011}, who observed occultations and derived a
$2\sigma$ upper limit on $| e\cos\omega | $ of 0.0024.
% \citet{caceres_ground-based_2011} report $e\cos\omega = 0.0027 \pm
% 0.0018$.  \citet{zhou_secondary_2015} report a weaker $e\cos\omega =
% -0.001 \pm 0.003$. 
Placing eccentricity limits stronger than $e< 10^{-3}$ has only been
possible for a few hot Jupiters, and with numerous false-starts.  HD
189733b, for example, was initially reported to have a non-zero
eccentricty \citep{knutson_map_2007}.  This result was retracted by
\citet{agol_climate_2010}, who used a larger dataset of 7 Spitzer
occultations and found a smaller average offset in the occultation
time than \citet{knutson_map_2007}.  \citet{agol_climate_2010} also
noted that a larger fraction of the planet's observed occultation time
offset could be explained by detailed modeling of the planetary
hot-spot, which can shift occultation times by up to a few minutes
\citep{williams_resolving_2006}.  Including an updated hot-spot model,
\citet{agol_climate_2010} reported $e\cos\omega < 0.00023$ at
2$\sigma$, perhaps the strongest eccentricity limit in place for a hot
Jupiter.  Similar sagas transpired for HD 209458b and WASP-12b, with
early reports of small non-zero eccentricities
\citep{winn_measurement_2005,hebb_wasp-12b_2009,lopez-morales_day-side_2010},
only to be ruled out by the limits of subsequent followup:
$|e\cos\omega| < 0.0007$ for HD 209458b, and $| e\cos\omega| < 0.0040$
($2\sigma$) for WASP-12b
\citep{crossfield_spitzer_mips_2012,campo_orbit_2011,croll_near-infrared_2011}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% A similar saga occurred for HD 209458b, for which
% \citet{winn_measurement_2005} combined Spitzer secondary eclipses with
% RV data and reported a small non-zero eccentricity.  They suspected that
% the data were consistent with zero eccentricity, and that the lower
% bound on $e$ was an artifact of an imperfect limb-darkening model.
% \citet{crossfield_spitzer_mips_2012} eventually ruled out the \citet{winn_measurement_2005} values, by determining
% $e\cos\omega < 0.0007$ at $2\sigma$.  The final example is WASP-12b, for
% which the discovery RVs and photometry gave a small finite eccentricity
% measurement \citep[][at $3\sigma$]{hebb_wasp-12b_2009}.  A prompt
% ground-based occultation measurement by
% \citet{lopez-morales_day-side_2010} concurred that a small eccentricity
% was favored with weak statistical significance. Further follow-up found
% occultation times consistent with circular orbits; $| e\cos\omega| <
% 0.0040 $ \citep{campo_orbit_2011,croll_near-infrared_2011}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To summarize, empirical constraints on the ellipticity of hot Jupiter
orbits at the $e \lesssim 10^{-3}$ level are present for only a
handful of hot Jupiters, from occultation timing.  Once the timing
offsets are of order tens of seconds, eccentricities from occultation
timing may have systematic uncertainties because of the hot-spot issue
\citep{williams_resolving_2006,agol_climate_2010}.  Except for
WASP-18b, radial velocity measurements have provided eccentricity
constraints only at the $e > 10^{-2}$ level.  We therefore cannot
empirically rule out hot Jupiter eccentricities at the level needed to
assess WASP-4's putative eccentricity.

\subsubsection{Theoretical expectations for small eccentricities in hot
Jupiter systems}

Lacking empirical data, we turn to theoretical mechanisms that could
produce small eccentricities.

\paragraph{Neighboring companion}
\citet{mardling_long-term_2007} considered the long-term tidal
evolution of hot Jupiters with companions.  The companion in their
model is coplanar, and can have a mass down to an Earth-mass; the main
requirement is that both the hot Jupiter and the outer companion start
on eccentric orbits.  They found that although the early phases of the
two-planet eccentricity evolution occur quickly, the final phase of
the joint eccentricity evolution towards circularity would occur on
timescales several orders of magnitude longer than the circularization
time (see their Figures~4 and 5).  

A different way to excite the hot Jupiter's eccentricity is the
Kozai-Lidov mechanism \citep{lidov_evolution_1962,kozai_secular_1962}.
In this case, the orbital plane of the outer companion, ``c'', would
need to be inclined relative to that of the hot Jupiter, ``b'', by at
least $\sin^{-1} \sqrt{2/5} \approx 39^\circ$.
%\citet{bailey_understanding_2019} point out how the joint requirements
%of Kozai-Lidov oscillations with a non-detection of an additional RV
%signal can be combined to produce lower and upper limits on the
%companion's mass.
For the Kozai-Lidov mechanism to operate at maximum efficiency, we
need \citep[][Equation 20]{bailey_understanding_2019}
\begin{equation}
  M_{\rm c} > 7.1\,M_\oplus
  \times \left( \frac{a_{\rm c}}{a_{\rm b}} \right)^{3/2},
  \label{eq:kozai_bound}
\end{equation}
where $M_{\rm b,c}$ and $a_{\rm b,c}$ are the mass and semi-major axis
of WASP-4b and the hypothetical WASP-4c, and we have assumed WASP-4b's
Love number is $k_{2,{\rm b}}\approx 0.6$.  For the RV signal of the
companion to remain undetected, it would need to be in the residual
$({\rm O-C})_{\rm RV} = 15.2\,{\rm m s}^{-1}$ reported by
\citet{triaud_spin-orbit_2010}.  Again following
\citet{bailey_understanding_2019}, this implies
\begin{align}
  M_{\rm c} &<
  ({\rm O-C})_{\rm RV}
  \left( \frac{M_\star a_b}{G} \right)^{1/2}
  \left( \frac{a_c}{a_b} \right)^{1/2}
  f^{-1/2}
  \nonumber
  \\
  M_{\rm c} &< 
  23.8\,M_\oplus
  \times 
  \left( \frac{a_c}{a_b} \right)^{1/2}
  f^{-1/2},
  \label{eq:rv_bound}
\end{align}
for $f(e_{\rm c},\omega_{\rm c}, i_{\rm c}) \propto \sin^2 i_{\rm c}$
a geometric prefactor that depends on the argument of periastron
$\omega_{\rm c}$ and inclination $i_{\rm c}$ of the exterior companion
(\citealt{bailey_understanding_2019} Equation 23).  Since WASP-4b
transits along the line of sight, $f$ can be arbitrarily small, and
both of the preceding limits can be satisfied. 

While either of the two preceding mechanisms could produce the needed
eccentricity, it would be more satifying if long-term radial velocity
monitoring showed an additional planet in the system.  The chances of
one existing with a mass between 1-13\,$M_{\rm Jup}$ and orbital
semi-major axis between 1-20\,AU is about 50\%, and a linear trend is
currently present at $\sim$2$\sigma$ \citep{knutson_friends_2014}.

\paragraph{Fluctuations in the gravitational potential from convection}
A separate mechanism to pump the eccentricity invokes the
gravitational fluctuations from stellar convection \citep[][Section
7]{phinney_pulsars_1992}.  Phinney presents this idea by analogy with
a pendulum, which is never really at rest. Instead, collisions with
air molecules randomly perturb its momentum and energy, and the
equipartition theorem of statistical mechanics tells us the average
energy is $\langle E_{\rm pend} \rangle = k T_{\rm air}$.  In hot
Jupiter systems, the ``air molecules'' are convective eddies, and
their associated kinetic energy perturbs the orbit away from
circularity.  The mean-squared eccentricity is \citep[][Equation
7.33]{phinney_pulsars_1992}
\begin{equation}
  \langle e^2 \rangle =
  \frac{ 2 \langle E_{\rm e} \rangle }{\mu n^2 a^2}
  = 6.8\times10^{-5}
  \frac{(L^2 R_{\rm conv}^2 M_{\rm conv}^2)^{1/3}}{\mu n^2 a^2},
\end{equation}
for $L$ the stellar luminosity, $R_{\rm conv}$ ($M_{\rm conv}$) the
width (mass) of the convective region,  $\mu$ the reduced mass, $n$
the orbital frequency, and $a$ the semi-major axis.  For WASP-4, we
find $\langle e^2 \rangle^{1/2} \lesssim 10^{-5}$; this mechanism
cannot produce the required eccentricity.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% LB: I calculated the above using MESA grids from Penev+ 2018 to
% estimate the core/envelope masses, but mentioning this is too
% detailed.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\subsection{Applegate effect}
Some eclipsing binaries exhibit period modulations with amplitudes of
$\lesssim 0.05\,{\rm days}$ over timescales of decades \citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{soderhjelm_geometry_1980,hall_relation_1989}.
\citet{applegate_mechanism_1992} proposed a mechanism to explain these
modulations in which the internal structure of a magnetically active
star changes shape via cyclic exchange of angular momentum between the
inner and outer zones of the star.  This model could also apply to a
hot Jupiter orbiting a star with a convective zone.  The changing
gravitational quadrupole of the star would cause the orbit of the
planet to precess on the timescale of the stellar activity cycle ("the
dynamo timescale").  An essential difference between this process and
apsidal precession is that Applegate timing variations are expected to
be quasi-periodic \citep[{\it
e.g.},][Figure~12]{soderhjelm_geometry_1980}.  The transit and
occultation deviations from the Applegate mechanism would also have
equal signs, while for apsidal precession they have opposite signs.
For WASP-4, \citet{watson_orbital_2010} estimated that the Applegate
effect could produce timing deviations of up to 15 seconds, depending
on the modulation period of the stellar dynamo, and the corresponding
level of differential surface shear.  If true, this mechanism cannot
explain the majority our observed $78$ second variation.


\subsection{Other possible explanations}

Another mechanism to produce the observed period change would be if an
unseen companion in the WASP-4 system accelerated the star towards our
line of sight.
This would produce a period derivative
\begin{equation}
	\dot{P} \approx \frac{\dot{v}_{\rm r} P}{c},
\end{equation}
for $\dot{v}_{\rm r}$ the time derivative of the radial velocity.
%Recently, \citet{bonomo_gaps_2017} collected all available HARPS data
%for the system, and reported no detectable slope at $3\sigma$.
%However,
\citet{knutson_friends_2014} collected 5 Keck HIRES radial
velocity measurements for WASP-4, and merged them with measurements
from CORALIE and HARPS \citep{wilson_wasp-4b_2008,pont_determining_2011,husnoo_observational_2012}.
Using these datasets, \citet{knutson_friends_2014} found 
\begin{equation}
\dot{v}_{\rm r} =
   -0.0099^{+0.0052}_{-0.0054}
   \,{\rm m}\,{\rm s}^{-1}\,{\rm day}^{-1},
\end{equation}
or that the
star can be accelerating towards us at most by $\dot{v}_{\rm r} > -
0.021 \,{\rm m}\,{\rm s}^{-1}\,{\rm day}^{-1}$ (2$\sigma$).
The associated $\dot{P}$ must be less than $9\times 10^{-11}$.  
Radial acceleration could thus cause at most one-quarter of the
observed period decrease (Equation~\ref{eq:dP_dt_obs}).
Improved radial velocity
monitoring will help clarify the situation,
particularly given that WASP-4 shows short-term RV trends with
amplitudes $\sim$$\mathcal{O}(10\,{\rm m\,s}^{-1})$, over tens of days
\citep{husnoo_observational_2012}.  Given that WASP-4 is a
magnetically active star \citep{sanchis-ojeda_starspots_2011}, these
short-timescale variations might conspire to produce spurious
RV signals over long baselines.

There are two other small effects worth noting.  The first is the
\citet{shklovskii_possible_1970} effect, in which the star's proper
motion leads to a changing radial velocity.  This would be apparent in
the Doppler measurements described above.  The effect contributes a
change of order $\dot{P} \sim P\mu^2 d/ c \sim 6\times10^{-13}$.  The
second effect, described by \citet{rafikov_stellar_2009}, comes from
the star's on-sky motion altering our viewing angle, and leads to an
observed apsidal precession.  The corresponding period change is
$\dot{P} \sim (P\mu)^2/2\pi \sim 10^{-21}$. Both effects are too small
to be of consequence in WASP-4.

Many of the phenomena we have discussed could presumably occur
simultaneously.  We found though that radial acceleration,
proper-motion, and the Applegate mechanism are unlikely to explain the
majority of the timing deviations.  Tidal decay seems implausible,
given the high level of dissipation required.  This leaves apsidal
precession as the most plausible explanation, but more data are needed
for a definitive interpretation.

\end{figure}

If the TESS mission is extended after its primary mission, it will
likely observe additional transits of WASP-4b in the early 2020s
(Figure~\ref{fig:future}).  High-precision ground-based transit
measurements could also be useful.  In order to rule between orbital
decay and apsidal precession, occultation measurements in both the
near term and also in the mid-2020s will be needed.  Additionally,
confirmation and extension of the linear RV trend suggested by
\citet{knutson_friends_2014} would help in understanding whether an
exterior companion in the system might explain any residual
eccentricity.  These observations should be carried out because they
will lead to new knowledge; either a measure of the stellar tidal
dissipation efficiency, or the eccentricity and Love number of the
planet.  Either outcome for a single system would be rather
interesting.  In the coming decade, wide-field photometric surveys
(TESS, HATPI, NGTS, PLATO) might even enable such measurements at a
population level, which would be extremely interesting.

\section{Verifying the TESS Time Stamps}
\label{sec:verify_tess}

Any systematic offset between the TESS times and the true barycentric
reference would cast doubt on the results of this study.  There is
historic precedent: Kepler had a systematic error in its timestamps
that was corrected only in Q14~\citep[][Section
3.4]{kepler_DR19_2013}.

We devised two checks on the absolute calibration of the TESS time
system.  First, in \S~\ref{sec:headers}, we recalculate and confirm
the barycentric correction reported by SPOC in the TESS lightcurve
file headers.  In \S~\ref{sec:hj_verification}, we measure the transit
times of other hot Jupiters, and use them to rule out a global TESS
time offset larger than about a minute.  The latter test confirms that
WASP-4b is an outlier.

\subsection{Using the headers of the lightcurve files}
\label{sec:headers}

The TESS lightcurve files provide observation start and end times in
three different time systems: ${\rm JD}_{\rm UTC}$, ${\rm JD}_{\rm
TDB}$, and ${\rm BJD}_{\rm TDB}$.  First, we verified for a few select
lightcurve files that ${\rm JD}_{\rm UTC}$ lagged behind ${\rm
JD}_{\rm TDB}$ by the expected $32.184 + N\,{\rm seconds}$, where $N$
is the number of leap-seconds since 1961. For the relevant observation
time, $N=37$, and the offset was as expected.  Then, using the ${\rm
JD}_{\rm UTC}$ timestamp, we recalculated the barycentric correction
computed by SPOC, using the \citealt{eastman_achieving_2010}
calculator.  Due to the first author's ignorance of the spacecraft
position, we assumed that the observer was located at the Earth's
geocenter, and used the correct direction for each star.  This gave us
times in ${\rm BJD}_{\rm TDB}$ that agreed with the archival times to
within 1.7 seconds.  This offset is comparable to the light-travel
delay expected for TESS on its orbit from perigee of $\approx
20R_\oplus$ to apogee of $\approx 60R_\oplus$.

This calculation bounds any error in the SPOC barycentric julian date
correction to be less than 1.7 seconds.  This is smaller than the
effect of interest, so we treat the SPOC BJD correction as
``verified'', and proceed to a subsequent test.


\subsection{Using other hot Jupiters as references}

    {\bf There is no evidence for a systematic offset between TESS
    times and the barycentric reference.} While the WASP-4b transits
    fell about 75 seconds earlier than expected, other well-observed
    hot Jupiters, in particular WASP-6b and WASP-18b, arrived on time.
    Ticks are observed TESS transit midtimes; the blue distribution is
    a kernel density estimate; the orange distribution is a gaussian
    centered on zero with standard deviation ($\sigma_{\rm
    predicted}$) calculated from the pre-TESS transit times.

\end{figure*}

If the observed timing delay in WASP-4b were caused by a systematic
offset between the TESS times and the ${\rm
BJD}_{\rm TDB}$ reference, we might expect that it would apply to
other hot Jupiters as well.  This test can rule out an important class
of clock error~--~a systematic global offset.

To explore this possibility, we repeat the timing analysis of the main
paper, for other hot Jupiters with long preceding observing baselines.
We first checked which hot Jupiters were observed over the first two
TESS sectors using a combination of
\texttt{tessmaps}\footnote{\url{github.com/lgbouma/tessmaps}} and
TEPCat \citep{southworth_homogeneous_2011}.  We then selected hot
Jupiters for which there were at least five distinct epochs reported
in the peer-reviewed literature.  We required that each observation be
of a single transit, that the midpoint be fit as a free parameter, and
that the time system be clearly documented.  Our final hot Jupiter
sample included WASP-4b, 5b, 6b, 18b, and 46b.  The collected and
measured times are given in Tables~5, 6, 7, and 8 for each.

Using the literature timing data for each hot Jupiter, we then
performed a least-squares fit to a linear ephemeris.  Using the
best-fit values and variances, we calculated the precision of the
predicted transit time during the TESS observing epoch.  This gave 11,
94, 18, 42, and 59 seconds for WASP-4b, 5b, 6b, 18b, and 46b.
Comparing the observed and predicted times, Figure~\ref{fig:hjs} shows
that WASP-4b is the only hot Jupiter that transited significantly
earlier than expected.

To convert this intuition into a quantitative limit, for each hot
Jupiter we considered the model
\begin{equation}
  t_{\rm tra}(E) = t_0 + PE + t_{\rm offset},
\end{equation}
for $t_{\rm offset}$ a systematic constant offset between the reported
timestamps and the true ${\rm BJD}_{\rm TDB}$ reference.  Our priors
were
\begin{align}
  t_0 &\sim \mathcal{N}[t_0', \sigma_{t_0'}], \\
  P &\sim \mathcal{N}[P', \sigma_{P'}], \\
  t_{\rm offset} &\sim \mathcal{U}[-20\sigma_{t_0'},20\sigma_{t_0'}],
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{N}$ and $\mathcal{U}$ denote a normal and uniform
distribution, $(t_0', P')$ are the best-fit reference time and period
using only the literature transit times, and $(\sigma_{t_0'},
\sigma_{P'})$ are their uncertainties.

For each planet, we then ask: what fraction of the posterior for
$t_{\rm offset}$ is consistent with an offset worse than $81.5$
seconds?  For WASP-4b, the answer is unsurpringly about half.  For
WASP-6b, the most constraining object, about 1 sample in 2 million is
consistent with such a timing offset ($4.9\sigma$).  For WASP-18b, 1
in 80 samples would be consistent with this timing offset
($2.2\sigma$), and in WASP-46b, the limit is 1 in 44 samples
($2.0\sigma$).  For WASP-5b, the predicted time is too imprecise to
rule out timing offsets at the necessary amplitude.  Multiplying the
three independent probabilities for WASP-5b, 6b, and 18b, we can rule
out $t_{\rm offset} < -81.5\ {\rm seconds}$ at $6.3\sigma$, or about
about 1 part in 8 billion.

% \section{Verifying the WASP-4 Archival Times}
% \label{sec:verify_archival_times}

%     {\bf Extra times for WASP-4b neither confirm nor refute the
%     	period-decay.}
%     Our timing analysis (Section~\ref{sec:timing}) imposes stringent
%     selection criteria for lightcurves.
%     Here we overplot additional points from the Exoplanet Transit
%     Database (ETD), and the discovery epoch from \citet{wilson_wasp-4b_2008}.
%     \label{fig:verify}
%   }
% \end{figure*}
% 
% The preceding analysis shows that the TESS timestamps are consistent
% at the requisite level with the ${\rm BJD}_{\rm TDB}$ reference.
% Another explanation for the WASP-4b timing variation could be
% incorrect archival times.
% As a sanity check on the times we included for our analysis in
% Table~1, we collected times from the Exoplanet Transit Database
% \citep[ETD; ][]{poddany_ETD_2010}.  We considered only the 12
% lightcurves of the highest self-reported quality (${\rm DQ} = 1$).  We
% then inspected each lightcurve by eye.  If the lightcurve showed
% substantial red noise, we discarded it.  This left 9 midtimes,
% reported in ${\rm HJD}_{\rm UTC}$. We converted the times to ${\rm
% BJD}_{\rm TDB}$ \citep{eastman_achieving_2010}.
% 
% The resulting times are shown in Figure \ref{fig:verify}.  Focusing on
% the epochs that overlap with \citet{huitson_gemini_2017}'s study, four
% of six possible times agree with the \citet{huitson_gemini_2017}
% times; the other two fall about 90 seconds early.  With their stated
% uncertainties, these 6 ETD data points are inconsistent with a
% constant period.  The 6 points came from 5 different observers.
% Systematic errors in absolute clock offsets by different observers
% should be uncorrelated; if there were such systematic errors in the
% ETD times, this could explain the many-sigma outliers.  Though the
% majority of the reported times do support the accuracy of the
% \citet{huitson_gemini_2017} times, a systematic procedure would call
% for averaging the ETD times.  If we did this, and discarded the four
% \citet{huitson_gemini_2017} epochs, it is likely that the evidence for
% period decay would become much weaker.  Since
% \citet{huitson_gemini_2017} documented their time system clearly, and
% produced lightcurves of extremely high quality, we included their times
% in our analysis.  From private correspondence with
% \citealt{huitson_gemini_2017}, the authors also stand by their
% timestamps. Since the ETD data come from
% heterogeneous sources, their timestamps are less clearly documented,
% and the times are thus more prone to systematic errors, we
% categorically omit them from consideration.
% 
% We also overplotted the discovery epoch reported by
% \citet{wilson_wasp-4b_2008}. 
% This epoch folded together WASP-S survey data, a partial FTS
% lightcurve, and a complete EulerCam lightcurve. 
% Though not explicitly stated by \citet{wilson_wasp-4b_2008}, the
% archival WASP-S lightcurves are in ${\rm HJD}_{\rm UTC}$, so they can
% be converted to ${\rm BJD}_{\rm TDB}$ without uncertainty in the
% absolute time reference (Collier-Cameron, priv.\ comm.).
% The discovery epoch falls about 2 minutes earlier than the epochs we
% used for the fit, and is visible in the lower left of Figure
% \ref{fig:verify}.

% Another independent line of evidence supporting the
% \citet{huitson_gemini_2017} times is that \citet{patra_2017} showed
% for WASP-12b that precise transit times reported by
% \citet{stevenson_transmission_2014} from the Gemini telescopes with
% GMOS are congruent with those from other observers.  This indicates
% that the telescopes do not have a long-standing clock offset.

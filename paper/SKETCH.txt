INTRO

* hunt for HJs has been happening for a long time, and it is gradually
  beginning to work (WASP-12)

* there will be annoying false positive as TESS data continues to come
  down: RV accelerators (Romer effect)

* this paper was prompted because we found Romer delay was a problem
  for WASP-4, and we didn't have sufficient RV data to know for sure.

* how big of a problem will this be, generally?
  * using known gammadots from Knutson+14
  * using population level expectations

* we see positive Pdot for HAT-P-7b. any others?

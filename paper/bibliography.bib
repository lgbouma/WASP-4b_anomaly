	abstract = {This article presents and discusses a critical compilation of accurate, fundamental determinations of stellar masses and radii. We have
identified 95 detached binary systems containing 190 stars (94 eclipsing systems, and α Centauri) that satisfy our criterion that the mass and radius of both stars be known within errors of ±3\% accuracy
or better. All of them are non-interacting systems, and so the stars should have evolved as if they were single. This sample more than doubles that of the earlier similar review by Andersen (Astron Astrophys Rev 3:91-126, 1991), extends the mass range at both ends and, for the first time, includes an extragalactic binary. In every case, we have examined the original data and recomputed the stellar parameters with a consistent set of assumptions and physical constants. To these we add interstellar reddening, effective temperature, metal abundance,
rotational velocity and apsidal motion determinations when available, and we compute a number of other physical parameters, notably luminosity and distance. These accurate physical parameters reveal the effects of stellar evolution with unprecedented clarity, and we discuss the use of the data in observational tests of stellar evolution models in some detail. Earlier findings of significant structural differences between moderately fast-rotating, mildly active stars and single stars, ascribed to the presence of strong magnetic and spot activity, are confirmed beyond doubt. We also show how the best data can be used to test prescriptions for the subtle interplay between convection, diffusion, and other non-classical effects in stellar models. The amount and quality of the data also allow us to analyse the tidal evolution of the systems in considerable depth, testing prescriptions of rotational synchronisation and orbital circularisation in greater detail than possible before. We show that the formulae for pseudo-synchronisation of stars in eccentric orbits predict the observed rotations quite well, except for very young and/or widely separated stars. Deviations do occur, however, especially for stars with convective envelopes. The superior data set finally demonstrates that apsidal motion rates as predicted from General Relativity plus tidal theory are in good
agreement with the best observational data. No reliable binary data exist, which challenge General Relativity to any significant extent. The new data also enable us to derive empirical calibrations of M and R for single (post-) main-sequence stars above \{0.6 M\_\{odot\}\}. Simple, polynomial functions of T eff, log g and [Fe/H] yield M and R within errors of 6 and 3\%, respectively. Excellent agreement is found with independent determinations for host stars of transiting extrasolar planets, and good agreement with determinations of M and R from stellar models as constrained by trigonometric parallaxes and spectroscopic values of T eff and [Fe/H]. Finally, we list a set of 23 interferometric binaries with masses known to be better than 3\%, but without fundamental radius determinations (except α Aur). We
discuss the prospects for improving these and other stellar parameters in the near future.},

tidally circularized, long after the dispersal of their natal disk. We
demonstrate that the two distinct segments of the boundary are a direct

fixes the mass coordinate of the intersection point. The period

	abstract = {Many exoplanets have now been detected in orbits with ultra-short periods very close to the Roche limit. Building upon our previous work, we study the possibility that mass loss through Roche lobe overflow (RLO) may affect the evolution of these planets, and could possibly transform a hot Jupiter into a lower-mass planet (hot Neptune or super-Earth). We focus here on systems in which the mass loss occurs slowly (“stable mass transfer” in the language of binary
star evolution) and we compute their evolution in detail with the binary evolution code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics. We include the effects of tides, RLO, irradiation, and photo-evaporation (PE) of the planet, as well as the stellar wind and magnetic braking. Our calculations all start with a hot Jupiter close to its Roche limit, in orbit around a Sun-like star. The initial orbital decay and onset of RLO are driven by tidal dissipation in the star. We confirm that such a system can indeed evolve to produce lower-mass planets in orbits of a few days. The RLO phase eventually ends and, depending on the details of the mass transfer and on the planetary core mass, the orbital period can remain around a few days for several Gyr. The remnant planets have rocky cores and some amount of envelope material, which is slowly removed via PE at a nearly constant orbital period; these have properties resembling many of the observed super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. For these remnant planets, we also predict an anti-correlation between mass and orbital period; very low-mass planets (Mpl ≲ 5
M⊕) in ultra-short periods (Porb {\textless} 1 day)
cannot be produced through this type of evolution.},

	abstract = {Many gaseous exoplanets in short-period orbits are on the verge or are in the process of Roche-lobe overflow (RLO). Moreover, orbital stability analysis shows tides can drive many hot Jupiters to spiral inevitably toward their host stars. Thus, the coupled processes of orbital evolution and RLO likely shape the observed distribution of close-in exoplanets and may even be responsible for producing some of the short-period rocky planets. However, the exact outcome for an overflowing planet depends on its internal response to mass loss, and the accompanying orbital evolution can act to enhance or inhibit RLO. In this study, we apply the fully-featured and robust Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics suite to model RLO of short-period gaseous planets. We show that, although the detailed evolution may depend on several properties of the planetary system, it is largely determined by the core mass of the overflowing gas giant. In particular, we find that the orbital expansion that accompanies RLO often stops and reverses at a specific maximum period that depends on the core mass. We suggest that RLO may often strand the remnant of a gas giant near this orbital period, which provides an observational prediction that can corroborate the hypothesis that short-period gas giants undergo RLO. We conduct a preliminary comparison of this prediction to the observed population of small, short-period planets and find some planets in orbits that may be consistent with this picture. To the extent that we can establish some short-period planets are indeed the remnants of gas giants, that population can elucidate the properties of gas giant cores, the properties of which remain largely unconstrained.},

planet and one for dissipation in the host star. We are able to
consistently describe the distribution of extrasolar planetary systems in terms of period, eccentricity, and mass (with a lower limit of a Saturn mass) with this simple model. Our model is consistent with the survival of short-period exoplanet systems, but not with the
circularization period of equal mass stellar binaries, suggesting that the latter systems experience a higher level of dissipation than exoplanet host stars. Our model is also not consistent with the
explanation of inflated planetary radii as resulting from tidal
dissipation. The paucity of short-period planets around evolved A stars is explained as the result of enhanced tidal inspiral resulting from the increase in stellar radius with evolution.},

Tides raised on a planet's host star cause the planet's orbit to decay, even after the orbital eccentricity has dropped to zero. Comparison of the observed orbital distribution and predictions of tidal theory shows good qualitative agreement, suggesting tidal destruction of close-in exoplanets is common. The process can explain the observed cutoff in small semimajor axis values, the clustering of orbital periods near three days, and the relative youth of transiting planets. Contrary to previous considerations, a mechanism to stop the inward migration of close-in planets at their current orbits is not necessarily required. Planets nearing tidal destruction may be found with extremely small semimajor axes, possibly already stripped of any gaseous envelope. The recently discovered CoroT-7 b may be an example of such a planet and will probably be destroyed by tides within the next few Gyrs. Also, where one or more planets have already been accreted, a star may exhibit an unusual composition and/or spin rate.},

  abstract = {In order to explain the inflated radii of some transiting extrasolar giant planets, we investigate a tidal heating scenario for the inflated planets WASP-4b, WASP-6b, WASP-12b, WASP-15b, and TrES-4. To do so, we assume that they retain a nonzero eccentricity, possibly by dint of continuing interaction with a third body. We calculate the amount of extra heating in the envelope that is then required to fit the radius of each planet, and we explore how this additional power depends on the planetary atmospheric opacity and on the mass of a heavy-element central core. There is a degeneracy between the core mass M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}core{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and the heating {\textbackslash}dot\{E\}\_heating. Therefore, in the case of tidal heating, there is for each planet a range of \{M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}core{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, e {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}/Q'{\textless}SUB{\textgreater} p {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\} that can lead to the same radius, where Q'{\textless}SUB{\textgreater} p {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is the tidal dissipation factor and e is the eccentricity. With this in mind, we also investigate the case of the non-inflated planet HAT-P-12b, which can admit solutions combining a heavy-element core and tidal heating. A substantial improvement of the measured eccentricities of such planetary systems could simplify this degeneracy by linking the two unknown parameters \{M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}core{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, Q'{\textless}SUB{\textgreater} p {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}.

The planet is only 1.5 times the separation from its host star at which it would be destroyed by Roche lobe overflow, and has a predicted remaining lifetime of just ̃40 Myr, assuming a tidal dissipation quality factor of Q\_\{*\vphantom{\{}\}{\textasciicircum}'\}=10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}6{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. Q\_\{*\vphantom{\{}\}{\textasciicircum}'\} is a key factor in determining how frictional processes within a host star affect the orbital evolution of its companion giant planets, but it is currently poorly constrained by observations.

We conclude that the most informative and straightforward constraints on Q\_\{*\vphantom{\{}\}{\textasciicircum}'\} will be obtained by direct observational measurements of the shift in transit arrival times in individual hot Jupiter systems. We show that this is achievable across the mass spectrum of exoplanet host stars within a decade, and will directly probe the effects of stellar interior structure on tidal dissipation.},

	abstract = {Tidal dissipation within a short-period transiting extrasolar planet perturbed by a companion object can drive orbital evolution of the system to a so-called tidal fixed point, in which the apses of the transiting planet and its perturber are aligned, and variations in orbital eccentricities vanish. Significant contribution to the apsidal precession rate is made by gravitational quadrupole fields, created by the transiting planets tidal and rotational distortions. The fixed-point orbital eccentricity of the inner planet is therefore a strong function of its interior structure. We illustrate these ideas in the specific context of the recently discovered HAT-P-13 exoplanetary system, and show that one can already glean important insights into the physical properties of the inner transiting planet. We present structural models of the planet, which indicate that its observed radius can be maintained for a one-parameter sequence of models that properly vary core mass and tidal energy dissipation in the interior. We use an octupole-order secular theory of the orbital dynamics to derive the dependence of the inner planet's eccentricity, e{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}b{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} , on its tidal Love number, k {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2b {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. We find that the currently measured eccentricity, e{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}b{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.021 ± 0.009, implies 0.116 \&lt; k {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2b {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; 0.425, 0 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊕{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}core{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; 120 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊕{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and 10, 000 \&lt; Q{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}b{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; 300, 000.

The satellite orbit may decay inward until the satellite is destroyed; the orbit may decay outward toward escape, although at an ever decreasing rate; or the satellite's orbital and planet's spin periods may approach stable synchronism. Which of these outcomes of tidal evolution is approached depends on the satellite-planet mass ratio and on the initial spin and orbital angular velocities. A simple criterion is derived which tells the outcome, and a universal diagram is constructed which shows the actual path of evolution for a system with arbitrary masses and angular velocities. The possibility that certain retrograde satellites have been lost from the solar system is reexamined by means of this diagram. Subject headings: celestial mechanics - planets},

If a transiting planet is on an eccentric orbit then the presence of another planet causes a secular advance of the transiting planet's pericentre over and above the effect of general relativity. Although this secular effect is impractical to detect over a small number of orbits, it causes long-term differences when future transits occur, much like the long-term decay observed in pulsars. Measuring this transit-timing delay would thus allow the detection of either one or more additional planets in the system or the first measurements of non-zero oblateness (J{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) of the central stars.},

For a transiting planet at 0.05 AU, either a quadrupole moment similar to that of the Sun or the gravitational tug from an Earth-like planet on an orbit of semimajor axis {\textasciitilde}0.2 AU and a relative inclination near the optimal 45° would cause a transit duration time derivative of {\textasciitilde}1 s yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}.},

If a transiting planet is on an eccentric orbit, the duration of transits T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}D{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is sensitive to the orientation of the orbital ellipse relative to the line of sight. The precession of the orbit results in a systematic variation in both the duration of individual transit events and the observed period between successive transits, P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}obs{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. The periastron of the ellipse slowly precesses due to general relativity and possibly the presence of other planets in the system. This secular precession can be detected through the long-term change in P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}obs{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} (transit timing variations, TTV) or in T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}D{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} (transit duration variations, TDV). We estimate the corresponding precession measurement precision for repeated future observations of the known eccentric transiting exoplanetary systems (XO-3b, HD 147506b, GJ 436b and HD 17156b) using existing or planned space-borne instruments. The TDV measurement improves the precession detection sensitivity by orders of magnitude over the TTV measurement. We find that TDV measurements over a approximately 4yr period can typically detect the precession rate to a precision well exceeding the level predicted by general relativity.},

Depending on the ratio of the mean density of the planet ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} to that of the star ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, a planet-star merger results in three possible outcomes. If ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}≳5, then the planet directly plunges below the stellar atmosphere before being disrupted by tidal forces. The dissipation of orbital energy creates a hot wake behind the planet, producing a extreme ultraviolet (EUV)/soft X-ray transient that increases in brightness and temperature as the planet sinks below the stellar surface. The peak luminosity L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}EUV/X{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ≲ 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}36{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} is achieved weeks to months prior to merger, after which the stellar surface is enshrouded by an outflow driven by the merger. The final stages of the inspiral are accompanied by an optical transient powered by the recombination of hydrogen in the outflow, which peaks at a luminosity of ̃10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}37{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}-10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}38{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} on a time-scale ̃days. If the star is instead significantly denser (ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}≲5), then the planet overflows its Roche lobe above the stellar surface. For ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}≲1 mass transfer is stable, resulting in the planet being accreted on the relatively slow time-scale set by tidal dissipation. However, for an intermediate-density range 1≲ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}≲5 mass transfer may instead be unstable, resulting in the dynamical disruption of the planet into an accretion disc around the star. Outflows from the super-Eddington accretion disc power an optical transient with a peak luminosity of ̃10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}37{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}-10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}38{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} and characteristic duration ̃week-months. Emission from the disc itself becomes visible once the accretion rate decreases below the Eddington rate, resulting in a bolometric brightening and shift of the spectral peak to ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths. Optical transients from both direct-impact merger and tidal-disruption events in some ways resemble classical novae, but can be distinguished by their higher ejecta mass and lower velocity around hundreds of km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, and by hard pre- and post-cursor emission, respectively. The most promising search strategy is with combined surveys of nearby massive galaxies (e.g. M31) at optical, UV and X-ray wavelengths with cadences from days to months.},

WASP-45b is a 1.03-MJup planet which passes in front of the

seen in the spectra of WASP-45 suggests that the star is

the star to be photospherically and chromospherically active.

We imposed circular orbits in our analyses as the radial-velocity data
are consistent with (near-)circular orbits, as could be expected from
both empirical and tidal-theory perspectives for such short-period,
˜Jupiter-mass planets. We discuss the impact of fitting for
eccentric orbits for such planets when not supported by the data. The
derived planetary and stellar radii depend on the fitted eccentricity
and these parameters inform intense theoretical efforts concerning tidal
circularization and heating, bulk planetary composition and the observed
systematic errors in planetary and stellar radii. As such, we recommend
exercising caution in fitting the orbits of short-period,

composed of a main-sequence star and a close-in hot Jupiter, based on 29
new high-quality light curves of transits events. In particular, one
transit of WASP-45 b and four of WASP-46 b were simultaneously observed
in four optical filters, while one transit of WASP-46 b was observed
with the NTT obtaining a precision of 0.30 mmag with a cadence of
roughly 3 min. We also obtained five new spectra of WASP-45 with the
FEROS spectrograph. We improved by a factor of 4 the measurement of the
radius of the planet WASP-45 b, and found that WASP-46 b is slightly
less massive and smaller than previously reported. Both planets now have
a more accurate measurement of the density (0.959 ± 0.077

detected radius variations with wavelength for both planets, in
particular in the case of WASP-45 b we found a slightly larger

Here we report the discovery of planet WASP-18b with an orbital period of 0.94days and a mass of ten Jupiter masses

Under the assumption that the tidal-dissipation parameter Q of the host star is of the order of 106, as measured for Solar System bodies and binary stars and as often applied to extrasolar planets, WASP-18b will be spiralling inwards on a timescale less than a thousandth that of the lifetime of its host star.

These light curves are used to measure the amplitude, shape and phase of the thermal phase effect for WASP-18 b. We find that our results for the thermal phase effect are limited to an accuracy of about 0.01 per cent by systematic noise sources of unknown origin. At this level of accuracy we find that the thermal phase effect has a peak-to-peak amplitude approximately equal to the secondary eclipse depth, has a sinusoidal shape and that the maximum brightness occurs at the same phase as mid-occultation to within about 5 ° at 3.6 μm
and to within about 10 ° at 4.5 μm. The shape and amplitude of
the thermal phase curve imply very low levels of heat redistribution within the atmosphere of the planet. We also perform a separate analysis to determine the system geometry by fitting a light curve model to the data covering the occultation and the transit. The secondary eclipse depths we measure at 3.6 and 4.5 μm are in good agreement with
previous measurements and imply a very low albedo for WASP-18 b. The parameters of the system (masses, radii, etc.) derived from our analysis are also in good agreement with those from previous studies, but with improved precision. We use new high-resolution imaging and published limits on the rate of change of the mean radial velocity to check for the presence of any faint companion stars that may affect our results. We find that there is unlikely to be any significant contribution to the flux at Spitzer wavelengths from a stellar companion to WASP-18. We find that there is no evidence for variations in the times of eclipse from a linear ephemeris greater than about 100 s over 3 years.},

	abstract = {The WASP-18 system, with its massive and extremely close-in planet, WASP-18b (M p = 10.3M J , a = 0.02 au, P = 22.6 hr), is one of the best-known exoplanet laboratories to directly measure Q‧, the modified tidal quality factor and proxy for efficiency of tidal dissipation, of the host star. Previous analysis predicted a rapid orbital decay of the planet toward its host star that should be
measurable on the timescale of a few years, if the star is as
dissipative as is inferred from the circularization of close-in
solar-type binary stars. We have compiled published transit and
secondary eclipse timing (as observed by WASP, TRAPPIST, and Spitzer) with more recent unpublished light curves (as observed by TRAPPIST and Hubble Space Telescope) with coverage spanning nine years. We find no signature of a rapid decay. We conclude that the absence of rapid orbital decay most likely derives from Q‧ being larger than was
inferred from solar-type stars and find that Q‧ ≥ 1 ×
106, at 95\% confidence; this supports previous work
suggesting that F stars, with their convective cores and thin convective envelopes, are significantly less tidally dissipative than solar-type stars, with radiative cores and large convective envelopes.},

combined analysis of the WASP photometry, high-precision followup
transit photometry and radial velocities yield a planetary mass
Mp = 0.503+0.019-0.038 MJ
and radius Rp = 1.224+0.051-0.052 R\_J,
resulting in a density ρp = 0.27 ± 0.05 ρ\_J.
The mass and radius for the host star are M\_ast =
0.88+0.05-0.08 M\_⊙ and R\_ast =
0.870+0.025-0.036 R\_⊙. The non-zero orbital
eccentricity e = 0.054{\textasciicircum}+0.018-0.015 that we measure suggests
that the planet underwent a massive tidal heating 1 Gyr ago that could
have contributed to its inflated radius. High-precision radial
velocities obtained during a transit allow us to measure a sky-projected
angle between the stellar spin and orbital axis β =
11+14-18 deg. In addition to similar published
measurements, this result favors a dominant migration mechanism based on
tidal interactions with a protoplanetary disk.

We then present high-precision photometry of four transits in the WASP-6 planetary system, two of which contain a starspot anomaly. All four transits were modelled using PRISM and GEMC, and the physical properties of the system calculated. We find the mass and radius of the host star to be 0.836 ± 0.063 M⊙ and 0.864 ± 0.024

RJup and a density of 0.244 ± 0.014
ρJup. These values are consistent with those found in the literature. In the likely hypothesis that the two spot anomalies are caused by the same starspot or starspot complex, we measure the stars rotation period and velocity to be 23.80 ± 0.15 d and 1.78
± 0.20 km s-1, respectively, at a colatitude of
75.8°. We find that the sky-projected angle between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbital axis is λ = 7.2° ±
3.7°, indicating axial alignment. Our results are consistent with and more precise than published spectroscopic measurements of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.

The observations were carried out using multi-object differential spectrophotometry with the Inamori-Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph on the Baade Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. We model systematic effects on the observed light curves using principal component analysis on the comparison stars and allow for the presence of short and long memory correlation structure in our Monte Carlo Markov Chain analysis of the transit light curves for WASP-6. The measured transmission spectrum presents a general trend of decreasing apparent planetary size with wavelength and lacks evidence for broad spectral features of Na and K predicted by clear atmosphere models. The spectrum is consistent with that expected for scattering that is more efficient in the blue, as could be caused by hazes or condensates in the atmosphere of WASP-6b. WASP-6b therefore appears to be yet another massive exoplanet with evidence for a mostly featureless transmission spectrum, underscoring the importance that hazes and condensates can have in determining the transmission spectra of exoplanets.},

From the derived light curves we have extracted the midtransit times, transit depths and transit durations for these events. The precise midtransit times obtained help improve the orbital periods and also constrain transit-time variations of the systems. For most cases the published system parameters successfully accounted for our observed light curves, but in some instances we derive improved planetary radii and orbital periods. We complemented our 2.1 m infrared observations using CCD z‧-band and B-band photometry (plus two
Hα filter observations) obtained with the Kitt Peak Visitor Center Telescope, and with four H-band transits observed in 2007 October with the NSO’s 1.6 m McMath-Pierce Solar Telescope. The principal
highlights of our results are (1) Our ensemble of J-band planetary radii agree with optical radii, with the best-fit relation being
(Rp/R∗)J = 0.0017 +
0.979(Rp/R∗)vis. (2) We observe starspot crossings during the transit of WASP-11/HAT-P-10. (3) We detect starspot crossings by HAT-P-11b (Kepler-3b), thus confirming that the magnetic evolution of the stellar active regions can be monitored even after the Kepler mission has ended. (4) We confirm a grazing transit for HAT-P-27/WASP-40. In total, we present 57 individual transits of 32 known exoplanet systems.},

The resulting spectrum covers the range 0.29-4.5 μm. We find evidence for modest stellar activity of WASP-6 and take it into account in the transmission spectrum. The overall main characteristic of the spectrum is an increasing radius as a function of decreasing wavelength
corresponding to a change of Δ (Rp / R*) = 0.0071 from 0.33 to 4.5 μm. The spectrum suggests an effective
extinction cross-section with a power law of index consistent with Rayleigh scattering, with temperatures of 973 ± 144 K at the
planetary terminator. We compare the transmission spectrum with
hot-Jupiter atmospheric models including condensate-free and
aerosol-dominated models incorporating Mie theory. While none of the clear-atmosphere models is found to be in good agreement with the data, we find that the complete spectrum can be described by models that include significant opacity from aerosols including Fe-poor
Mg2SiO4, MgSiO3, KCl and
Na2S dust condensates. WASP-6b is the second planet after HD 189733b which has equilibrium temperatures near ˜1200 K and shows prominent atmospheric scattering in the optical.},

Combining them with other available photometric and radial velocity (RV) data, we find that its transit timings do not match a linear ephemeris; the best-fit χ2 value is 32.2 with 9 degrees of freedom, which corresponds to a confidence level of 99.982\% or 3.7σ. This result indicates that excess variations of transit timings have been observed, either due to unknown systematic effects, or possibly due to real TTVs. The TTV amplitude is as large as 50 s, and if this is real it cannot be explained by some effect other than an additional body, or bodies. From RV data, we put an upper limit on the RV amplitude caused by a possible secondary body (planet) as 21 m s-1, which corresponds to its mass of 22-70M⊕ over the orbital period ratio of the two planets from 0.2 to 5.0. From the TTV data, using numerical simulations, we narrowed the limits down to 2M⊕ near 1:2 and 2:1 mean-motion resonances (MMRs) with WASP-5b at the 3σ level, assuming that the two planets are
co-planer. We also put an upper limit of 43M⊕
(3σ) on excess of Trojan mass using both RV and photometric data. We also find that if the orbit of the possible secondary planet is a circle or an ellipse of small eccentricity, it would be likely an orbit near that of low-order MMRs.},

We construct detailed signal-to-noise ratio calculations for defocused

predictions from theoretical stellar evolutionary models to derive the
physical properties of the WASP-5 system. We find that the planet has a

In the case of WASP-46b, we found evidence of deviations indicating the presence of a companion but statistical analysis of the existing times points to a signal due to the sampling rather than a new planet. Finally, we studied the fractional radius variation as a function of wavelength for these systems. The broad-band spectrums of WASP-5b and WASP-44b are mostly flat.

Our new simulations differ from previous work by using (1) an updated photometric noise model that accounts for the nominal pointing jitter estimated through simulation prior to launch, (2) improved stellar parameters based on Gaia mission Data Release 2, (3) improved empirically-based simulation of multi-planet systems, (4) a realistic method of selecting targets for 2-minute exposures, and (5) a more realistic geometric distortion model to determine the sky region that falls on TESS CCDs. We also present simulations of the planet yield for three suggested observing strategies of the TESS extended mission. We report {\textasciitilde}\$10{\textasciicircum}4\$ planets to be discovered by the TESS primary mission, as well as an additional \${\textbackslash}sim 2000\$ planets for each year of the three extended mission scenarios we explored. We predict that in the primary mission, TESS will discover about 3500 planets with Neptune size and smaller, half of which will orbit stars with TESS magnitudes brighter than 12. Specifically, we proposed a new extended mission scenario that centers Camera 3 on the ecliptic pole (C3PO), which will yield more long period planets as well as moderately irradiated planets that orbit F, G, and K stars.},

To provide a head start to those who will plan and propose for such a mission, we present simulations of exoplanet detections in a third year of TESS operations. Our goal is to provide a helpful reference for the exoplanet-related aspects of any Extended Mission, while recognizing this will be only one part of a larger community discussion of the scientific goals. We use Monte Carlo simulations to try and anticipate the quantities and types of planets that would be detected in each of 6 plausible scenarios for a one-year Extended Mission following the two-year Primary Mission. We find that: (1) there is no sharp fall-off in the planet discovery rate in the third year; (2) the quantity of newly detected sub-Neptune radius planets does not depend strongly on the schedule of pointings; (3) an important function of an Extended Mission would be improving our ability to predict the times of future transits and occultations of TESS-detected planets.},

They are examined with respect to observational manifestations which characterize already known CA stars: Ca II H and K emission cores, photometric variability attributable to starspots, soft x-ray emission, non-thermal radio emission, ultraviolet and infrared excess, and alternating period changes. The conclusion is that they can be regarded as another class of CA stars. In most respects they are literally indistinguishable from other CA stars. Ca II H and K emission cores are observed in the lobe-filling component of six semi-detached binaries: U Cep, RT Lac, RV Lib, AR Mon, S Vel, HR 5110. Alternating period changes are shown to occur only in Algols containing a late-type (convective) star. It is proposed, therefore, that the Matese-Whitmire mechanism explains these changes. Specifically, the interval from one increase (or decrease) to the next can be equated with the star's magnetic cycle. Cycle lengths for 31 stars, derived in this way, range between 7 years and 109 years, with a median of 50 years.},

The main part of the work is a simultaneous analysis of 21 different photoelectric light-curves. The secondary component fills its Roche lobe, and its temperature is near 5000 K (plus or minus 500 K). The observations of circumstellar matter cannot be explained by a narrow ('particle dynamics') stream from Algol B to Algol A, and probably magnetic forces play a role. The period-changes indicate that mass and angular momentum are lost from the system, and again magnetic interactions could be involved. Speculatively, the 32(y) periodicity (which is not strict) is interpreted as some kind of magnetic cycle.},

	abstract = {Of the 14 transiting extrasolar planetary systems for which radii have been measured, at least three appear to be considerably larger than theoretical estimates suggest. It has been proposed by Bodenheimer, Lin \&amp; Mardling that undetected companions acting to excite the orbital eccentricity are responsible for these oversized planets, as they find new equilibrium radii in response to being tidally heated. In the case of HD 209458, this hypothesis has been rejected by some authors because there is no sign of such a companion at the 5 ms{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} level, and because it is difficult to say conclusively that the eccentricity is non-zero. Transit timing analysis as well as a direct transit search has further constrained the existence of very short period companions, especially in resonant orbits. Whether or not a companion is responsible for the large radius of HD 209458b, almost certainly some short-period systems have companions which force their eccentricities to non-zero values. This paper is dedicated to quantifying this effect. The eccentricity of a short-period planet will only be excited as long as its (non-resonant) companion's eccentricity is non-zero. Here, we show that the latter decays on a time-scale which depends on the structure of the interior planet, a time-scale which is often shorter than the lifetime of the system. This includes Earth-mass planets in the habitable zones of some stars. We determine which configurations are capable of sustaining significant eccentricity for at least the age of the system, and show that these include systems with companion masses as low as a fraction of an Earth mass. The orbital parameters of such companions are consistent with recent calculations which show that the migration process can induce the formation of low-mass planets external to the orbits of hot Jupiters. Systems with inflated planets are therefore good targets in the search for terrestrial planets.},

	abstract = {As clocks, pulsars rival the best atomic clocks on Earth. Though the rest-frame `tick' rate (period P) of any given pulsar is unknown, the rest-frame rates of change of the periods are known to be very small. Therefore when they are observed to be large, one is quite certain that the rate of changes must be due to changing Doppler shifts: dot\{P\} to acceleration, ddot\{P\} to jerk, and periodic shifts to orbiting companion stars or planets. The first two give otherwise unobtainable information on the density and masses of the stellar remnants in the cores of globular clusters. The orbits of binary pulsars provide a test of the theory of the evolution of red giant stars, and in globular clusters provide the first direct evidence for the three- and four-body encounters which are believed to determine the dynamical evolution of globular clusters. The orbits of binary pulsars in our own Galaxy also show evidence for the fluctuations which the fluctuation-dissipation theorem implies should occur during the dissipative tidal circularization of orbits. And newtonian dynamical effects may soon add irrefutable confirmation to recent observations suggesting that some pulsars are surrounded by planetary systems similar to our own. There may not be life on their planets, but pulsars certainly breathe new life into the study of newtonian dynamical systems.},

transiting extrasolar planets to probe the spatial variation of their
thermal emission. This technique permits an observer to resolve the
surface of the planet without the need to spatially isolate its light
from that of the central star. We evaluate the feasibility of this
technique for the HD 209458 system by simulating observations made with
the Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC). We consider two
representations of the planetary thermal emission: a simple model
parameterized by a sinusoidal dependence on longitude and latitude, and
the results of a three-dimensional dynamical simulation of the planetary
atmosphere previously published by Cooper \& Showman. We find that
observations of the secondary eclipse light curve are most sensitive to
a longitudinal asymmetry in the dayside planetary emission. To quantify
this signal, we define a new parameter, the ``uniform time offset,''
which measures the time lag between the observed secondary eclipse and
that predicted by a planet with spatially uniform emission. We compare
the predicted amplitude of this parameter for HD 20948 with the
precision with which it could be measured with IRAC. We find that IRAC
observations at 3.6μm of a single secondary eclipse should permit
sufficient precision to confirm or reject the Cooper \& Showman model
of the surface flux distribution for this planet. We quantify the
signal-to-noise ratio for this offset in the remaining IRAC bands and
find that a modest improvement in photometric precision should permit a
similarly robust detection.},

	abstract = {We observed two secondary eclipses of the exoplanet WASP-12b using the Infrared Array Camera on the Spitzer Space Telescope. The close proximity of WASP-12b to its G-type star results in extreme tidal forces capable of inducing apsidal precession with a period as short as a few decades. This precession would be measurable if the orbit had a significant eccentricity, leading to an estimate of the tidal Love number and an assessment of the degree of central concentration in the planetary interior. An initial ground-based secondary-eclipse phase reported by López-Morales et al. (0.510 ± 0.002) implied eccentricity at the 4.5σ level. The spectroscopic orbit of Hebb et al. has eccentricity 0.049 ± 0.015, a 3σ result, implying an eclipse phase of 0.509 ± 0.007. However, there is a well-documented tendency of spectroscopic data to overestimate small eccentricities. Our eclipse phases are 0.5010 ± 0.0006 (3.6 and 5.8 μm) and 0.5006 ± 0.0007 (4.5 and 8.0 μm). An unlikely orbital precession scenario invoking an alignment of the orbit during the Spitzer observations could have explained this apparent discrepancy, but the final eclipse phase of López-Morales et al. (0.510 ±{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.007{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.006{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) is consistent with a circular orbit at better than 2σ. An orbit fit to all the available transit, eclipse, and radial-velocity data indicates precession at \&lt;1σ a non-precessing solution fits better.

Our photometry brackets the secondary eclipse of WASP-12b in the Ks and H bands, and in J band starts in mid-eclipse and continues until well after the end of the eclipse. We detect its thermal emission in all three near-infrared bands. Our secondary eclipse depths are 0.309{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.013{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.012{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\% in Ks band (24σ), 0.176{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.016{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.021{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\% in H band (9σ), and 0.131{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.027{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.029{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\% in J band (4σ). All three secondary eclipses are best fit with a consistent phase, phi, that is compatible with a circular orbit: phi = 0.4998{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.0008{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.0007{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. The limits on the eccentricity, e, and argument of periastron, ω, of this planet from our photometry alone are thus {\textbar}ecos ω{\textbar} \&lt; 0.0040. By combining our secondary eclipse times with others published in the literature, as well as the radial-velocity and transit-timing data for this system, we show that there is no evidence that WASP-12b is precessing at a detectable rate and that its orbital eccentricity is likely zero. Our thermal-emission measurements also allow us to constrain the characteristics of the planet's atmosphere; our Ks-band eclipse depth argues strongly in favor of inefficient day to nightside redistribution of heat and a low Bond albedo for this very highly irradiated hot Jupiter. The J- and H-band brightness temperatures are slightly cooler than the Ks-band brightness temperature, and thus hint at the possibility of a modest temperature inversion deep in the atmosphere of WASP-12b; the high-pressure, deep atmospheric layers probed by our J- and H-band observations are likely more homogenized than the higher altitude layer probed by our Ks-band observations. Lastly, our best-fit Ks-band eclipse has a marginally longer duration than would otherwise be expected; this may be tentative evidence for material being tidally stripped from the planet—as was predicted for this system by Li and collaborators, and for which observational confirmation was recently arguably provided by Fossati and collaborators.

	abstract = {We report the results of an analysis of all Spitzer/MIPS 24 μm observations of HD 209458b, one of the touchstone objects in the study of irradiated giant planet atmospheres. Altogether, we analyze two and a half transits, three eclipses, and a 58 hr near-continuous observation designed to detect the planet's thermal phase curve. The results of our analysis are: (1) a mean transit depth of 1.484\% ± 0.033\%, consistent with previous measurements and showing no evidence of variability in transit depth at the 3\% level. (2) A mean eclipse depth of 0.338\% ± 0.026\%, somewhat higher than that previously reported for this system; this new value brings observations into better agreement with models. From this eclipse depth we estimate an average dayside brightness temperature of 1320 ± 80 K; the dayside flux shows no evidence of variability at the 12\% level. (3) Eclipses in the system occur 32 ± 129 s earlier than would be expected from a circular orbit, which constrains the orbital quantity ecos ω to be 0.00004 ± 0.00033. This result is fully consistent with a circular orbit and sets an upper limit of 140 m s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} (3σ) on any eccentricity-induced velocity offset during transit. The phase curve observations (including one of the transits) exhibit an anomalous trend similar to the detector ramp seen in previous Spitzer/IRAC observations; by modeling this ramp we recover the system parameters for this transit. The long-duration photometry which follows the ramp and transit exhibits a gradual {\textasciitilde}0.2\% decrease in flux over {\textasciitilde}30 hr. This effect is similar to that seen in pre-launch calibration data taken with the 24 μm array and is better fit by an instrumental model than a model invoking planetary emission. The large uncertainties associated with this poorly understood, likely instrumental effect prevent us from usefully constraining the planet's thermal phase curve. Our observations highlight the need for a thorough understanding of detector-related instrumental effects on long timescales when making the high-precision mid-infrared measurements planned for future missions such as EChO, SPICA, and the James Webb Space Telescope.},

We develop a new technique for modeling this effect and use it to determine the inclination of the planetary orbit relative to the apparent stellar equator (λ=-4.4d+/-1.4d), and the line-of-sight rotation speed of the star (vsinI{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=4.70+/-0.16 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}). The uncertainty in these quantities has been reduced by an order of magnitude relative to the pioneering measurements by Queloz and collaborators.

We use several novel techniques in our data analysis, the most important of which is a new correction for the detector "ramp" variation with a double-exponential function, which performs better and is a better physical model for this detector variation. Our main scientific findings are (1) an upper limit on the variability of the dayside planet flux of 2.7\% (68\% confidence); (2) the most precise set of transit times measured for a transiting planet, with an average accuracy of 3 s; (3) a lack of transit-timing variations, excluding the presence of second planets in this system above 20\% of the mass of Mars in low-order mean-motion resonance at 95\% confidence; (4) a confirmation of the planet's phase variation, finding the night side is 64\% as bright as the day side, as well as an upper limit on the nightside variability of 17\% (68\% confidence); (5) a better correction for stellar variability at 8 μm causing the phase function to peak 3.5 hr before secondary eclipse, confirming that the advection and radiation timescales are comparable at the 8 μm photosphere; (6) variation in the depth of transit, which possibly implies variations in the surface brightness of the portion of the star occulted by the planet, posing a fundamental limit on non-simultaneous multi-wavelength transit absorption measurements of planet atmospheres; (7) a measurement of the infrared limb darkening of the star, which is in good agreement with stellar atmosphere models; (8) an offset in the times of secondary eclipse of 69 s, which is mostly accounted for by a 31 s light-travel time delay and 33 s delay due to the shift of ingress and egress by the planet hot spot; this confirms that the phase variation is due to an offset hot spot on the planet; (9) a retraction of the claimed eccentricity of this system due to the offset of secondary eclipse, which is now just an upper limit; and (10) high-precision measurements of the parameters of this system. These results were enabled by the exquisite photometric precision of Spitzer IRAC; for repeat observations the scatter is less than 0.35 mmag over the 590 day timescale of our observations after decorrelating with detector parameters.},

	abstract = {`Hot Jupiter' extrasolar planets are expected to be tidally locked because they are close (\&lt;0.05 astronomical units, where 1AU is the average Sun-Earth distance) to their parent stars, resulting in permanent daysides and nightsides. By observing systems where the planet and star periodically eclipse each other, several groups have been able to estimate the temperatures of the daysides of these planets. A key question is whether the atmosphere is able to transport the energy incident upon the dayside to the nightside, which will determine the temperature at different points on the planet's surface. Here we report observations of HD 189733, the closest of these eclipsing planetary systems, over half an orbital period, from which we can construct a `map' of the distribution of temperatures. We detected the increase in brightness as the dayside of the planet rotated into view. We estimate a minimum brightness temperature of 973+/-33K and a maximum brightness temperature of 1,212+/-11K at a wavelength of 8μm, indicating that energy from the irradiated dayside is efficiently redistributed throughout the atmosphere, in contrast to a recent claim for another hot Jupiter. Our data indicate that the peak hemisphere-integrated brightness occurs 16+/-6° before opposition, corresponding to a hotspot shifted east of the substellar point. The secondary eclipse (when the planet moves behind the star) occurs 120+/-24s later than predicted, which may indicate a slightly eccentric orbit.},

Consequently, conventional circularization and synchronization timescales cannot be defined because the corresponding states do not represent the endpoint of the tidal evolution. Using numerical simulations of the coupled tidal equations for the spin and orbital parameters of each transiting planetary system, we confirm these predictions and show that the orbital eccentricity and the stellar obliquity do not follow the usually assumed exponential relaxation but instead decrease significantly, eventually reaching a zero value only during the final runaway merging of the planet with the star. The only characteristic evolution timescale of all rotational and orbital parameters is the lifetime of the system, which crucially depends on the magnitude of tidal dissipation within the star. These results imply that the nearly circular orbits of transiting planets and the alignment between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbit are unlikely to be due to tidal dissipation. Other dissipative mechanisms, for instance interactions with the protoplanetary disk, must be invoked to explain these properties.},

	abstract = {Recent discoveries of several transiting planets with clearly non-zero eccentricities and some large obliquities started changing the simple picture of close-in planets having circular and well-aligned orbits. The two major scenarios that form such close-in planets are planet migration in a disk and planet-planet interactions combined with tidal dissipation. The former scenario can naturally produce a circular and low-obliquity orbit, while the latter implicitly assumes an initially highly eccentric and possibly high-obliquity orbit, which are then circularized and aligned via tidal dissipation. Most of these close-in planets experience orbital decay all the way to the Roche limit as previous studies showed. We investigate the tidal evolution of transiting planets on eccentric orbits, and find that there are two characteristic evolution paths for them, depending on the relative efficiency of tidal dissipation inside the star and the planet. Our study shows that each of these paths may correspond to migration and scattering scenarios. We further point out that the current observations may be consistent with the scattering scenario, where the circularization of an initially eccentric orbit occurs before the orbital decay primarily due to tidal dissipation in the planet, while the alignment of the stellar spin and orbit normal occurs on a similar timescale to the orbital decay largely due to dissipation in the star. We also find that even when the stellar spin-orbit misalignment is observed to be small at present, some systems could have had a highly misaligned orbit in the past, if their evolution is dominated by tidal dissipation in the star. Finally, we also re-examine the recent claim by Levrard et al. that all orbital and spin parameters, including eccentricity and stellar obliquity, evolve on a similar timescale to orbital decay. This counterintuitive result turns out to have been caused by a typo in their numerical code. Solving the correct set of tidal equations, we find that the eccentricity behaves as expected, with orbits usually circularizing rapidly compared to the orbital decay rate.},

During its 2-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical charge-coupled device cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with I{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}C{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}≈4-13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from 1 month to 1 year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10 to 100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every 4 months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets. The TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting transiting planets, which will endure as highly favorable targets for detailed investigations.},

	abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the
	scientific community focusses on data processing for which the
	international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and
	subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built
	spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page.

	abstract = {Context. We present the second Gaia data release, Gaia DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system. Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey.
	Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results. Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data
	products. Results: Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the GBP (330-680 nm) and
	GRP (630-1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent. Conclusions: Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement for the Gaia mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.},

	abstract = {In anticipation of improved observational data for Jupiter’s gravitational field, from the Juno spacecraft, we predict the static tidal response for a variety of Jupiter interior models based on ab initio computer simulations of hydrogen-helium mixtures. We calculate hydrostatic-equilibrium gravity terms, using the non-perturbative concentric Maclaurin Spheroid method that eliminates lengthy expansions used in the theory of figures. Our method captures terms arising from the coupled tidal and rotational perturbations, which we find to be important for a rapidly rotating planet like Jupiter. Our predicted static tidal Love number, \{k\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=0.5900, is ̃10\% larger than previous estimates. The value is, as expected, highly correlated with the zonal harmonic coefficient J {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and is thus nearly constant when plausible changes are made to the interior structure while holding J {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} fixed at the observed value. We note that the predicted static k {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} might change, due to Jupiter’s dynamical response to the Galilean moons, and find reasons to argue that the change may be detectable—although we do not present here a theory of dynamical tides for highly oblate Jovian planets. An accurate model of Jupiter’s tidal response will be essential for interpreting Juno observations and identifying tidal signals from effects of other interior dynamics of Jupiter’s gravitational field.},

	abstract = {We present Spitzer Space Telescope infrared photometric time series of the transiting extrasolar planet system TrES-1. The data span a predicted time of secondary eclipse, corresponding to the passage of the planet behind the star. In both bands of our observations, we detect a flux decrement with a timing, amplitude, and duration as predicted by published parameters of the system. This signal represents the first direct detection of (i.e., the observation of photons emitted by) a planet orbiting another star. The observed eclipse depths (in units of relative flux) are 0.00066+/-0.00013 at 4.5 μm and 0.00225+/-0.00036 at 8.0 μm. These estimates provide the first observational constraints on models of the thermal emission of hot Jupiters. Assuming that the planet emits as a blackbody, we estimate an effective temperature of T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=1060+/-50 K. Under the additional assumptions that the planet is in thermal equilibrium with the radiation from the star and emits isotropically, we find a Bond albedo of A=0.31+/-0.14. This would imply that the planet absorbs the majority of stellar radiation incident upon it, a conclusion of significant impact to atmospheric models of these objects. We also compare our data to a previously published model of the planetary thermal emission, which predicts prominent spectral features in our observational bands due to water and carbon monoxide. This model adequately reproduces the observed planet-to-star flux ratio at 8.0 μm however, it significantly overpredicts the ratio at 4.5 μm. We also present an estimate of the timing of the secondary eclipse, which we use to place a strong constraint on the expression ecosω, where e is the orbital eccentricity and ω is the longitude of periastron. The resulting upper limit on e is sufficiently small that we conclude that tidal dissipation is unlikely to provide a significant source of energy interior to the planet.},

multiple light curves at varying wavelengths. The `white' light curve
and 15 `spectral' light curves are analysed to refine the system
parameters and produce a transmission spectrum from ˜515 to 720
nm. All light curves exhibit time-correlated noise, which we model using
a variety of techniques. These include a simple noise rescaling, a
Gaussian process model and a wavelet-based method. These methods all
produce consistent results, although with different uncertainties. The
precision of the transmission spectrum is improved by subtracting a
common signal from all the spectral light curves, reaching a typical
precision of ˜1 × 10-4 in transit depth. The
transmission spectrum is free of spectral features, and given the
non-detection of a pressure broadened Na feature, we can rule out the
presence of a Na-rich atmosphere free of clouds or hazes, although we
cannot rule out a narrow Na core. This indicates that Na is not present
in the atmosphere, and/or that clouds/hazes play a significant role in
the atmosphere and mask the broad wings of the Na feature, although the
former is a more likely explanation given WASP-29b's equilibrium
temperature of ˜970 K, at which Na can form various compounds. We
also briefly discuss the use of Gaussian process and wavelet methods to
account for time-correlated noise in transit light curves.},

Observations of eclipses - transits and occultations - provide a bonanza of information that cannot be obtained from radial-velocity data alone, such as the relative dimensions of the planet and its host star, as well as the orientation of the planet's orbit relative to the sky plane and relative to the stellar rotation axis. The wavelength-dependence of the eclipse signal gives clues about the temperature and composition of the planetary atmosphere. Anomalies in the timing or other properties of the eclipses may betray the presence of additional planets or moons. Searching for eclipses is also a productive means of discovering new planets. This chapter reviews the basic geometry and physics of eclipses, and summarizes the knowledge that has been gained through eclipse observations, as well as the information that might be gained in the future.},

	abstract = {Accurately understanding the interior structure of extra-solar planets is critical for inferring their formation and evolution. The internal density distribution of a planet has a direct effect on the star-planet orbit through the gravitational quadrupole field created by the rotational and tidal bulges. These quadrupoles induce apsidal precession that is proportional to the planetary Love number (\$k\_\{2p\}\$, twice the apsidal motion constant), a bulk physical characteristic of the planet that depends on the internal density distribution, including the presence or absence of a massive solid core. We find that the quadrupole of the planetary tidal bulge is the dominant source of apsidal precession for very hot Jupiters (\$a {\textbackslash}lesssim 0.025\$ AU), exceeding the effects of general relativity and the stellar quadrupole by more than an order of magnitude. For the shortest-period planets, the planetary interior induces precession of a few degrees per year. By investigating the full photometric signal of apsidal precession, we find that changes in transit shapes are much more important than transit timing variations. With its long baseline of ultra-precise photometry, the space-based {\textbackslash}emph\{Kepler\} mission can realistically detect apsidal precession with the accuracy necessary to infer the presence or absence of a massive core in very hot Jupiters with orbital eccentricities as low as \$e {\textbackslash}simeq 0.003\$. The signal due to \$k\_\{2p\}\$ creates unique transit light curve variations that are generally not degenerate with other parameters or phenomena. We discuss the plausibility of measuring \$k\_\{2p\}\$ in an effort to directly constrain the interior properties of extra-solar planets.},

Linearly resonant g-modes (the dynamical tide) are driven to such large amplitudes in the stellar core that they excite a sea of other g-modes through weakly nonlinear interactions. By solving the dynamics of large networks of nonlinearly coupled modes, we show that the nonlinear dissipation rate of the dynamical tide is several orders of magnitude larger than the linear dissipation rate.

Tidal interaction can modify the dynamics of the system through orbital alignment, circularization, synchronization and orbital decay by exchange of angular moment. Evidence for tidal circularization in close-in giant planet is well known. Here, we review the evidence for excess rotation of the parent stars due to the pull of tidal forces towards spin-orbit synchronization. We find suggestive empirical evidence for such a process in the present sample of transiting planetary systems. The corresponding angular momentum exchange would imply that some planets have spiralled towards their star by substantial amounts since the dissipation of the protoplanetary disc. We suggest that this could quantitatively account for the observed mass-period relation of close-in gas giants. We discuss how this scenario can be further tested and point out some consequences for theoretical studies of tidal interactions and for the detection and confirmation of transiting planets from radial velocity and photometric surveys.},

of the 4 Gyr-old open cluster M67 (=NGC 2682), obtained by analyzing
data from Campaign 5 of the K2 mission with the Kepler Space Telescope.
The rotation periods delineate a sequence in the color-period
diagram (CPD) of increasing period with redder color. This sequence
represents a cross-section at the cluster age of the surface P = P(t,
M), suggested in prior work to extend to at least solar age. The current
Sun is located marginally (approximately 1σ) above M67 in the CPD,
as its relative age leads us to expect, and lies on the P = P(t, M)
surface to within measurement precision. We therefore conclude that the
solar rotation rate is normal as compared with cluster stars, a fact
that strengthens the solar-stellar connection. The agreement
between the M67 rotation period measurements and prior predictions
further implies that rotation periods, especially when coupled with
appropriate supporting work such as spectroscopy, can provide reliable
ages via gyrochronology for other similar FGK dwarfs from the early main
sequence to solar age and likely until the main sequence turnoff. The
M67 rotators have a rotational age of 4.2 Gyr with a standard deviation
of 0.7 Gyr, implying that similar field stars can be age-dated to
precisions of ˜17\%. The rotational age of the M67 cluster as a
whole is therefore 4.2 Gyr, but with a lower (averaged) uncertainty of
0.2 Gyr.},

The distribution of orbital eccentricity versus orbital period (e-logP) displays a distinct transition from eccentric to circular orbits at an orbital period of {\textasciitilde}10 days. The transition is due to tidal circularization of the closest binaries. The population of binary orbits in M35 provide a significantly improved constraint on the rate of tidal circularization at an age of 150 Myr. We propose a new and more robust diagnostic of the degree of tidal circularization in a binary population based on a functional fit to the e-logP distribution. We call this new measure the ``tidal circularization period.'' The tidal circularization period of a binary population represents the orbital period at which a binary orbit with the most frequent initial orbital eccentricity circularizes (defined as e=0.01) at the age of the population. We determine the tidal circularization period for M35, as well as for seven additional binary populations spanning ages from the pre-main sequence ({\textasciitilde}3 Myr) to the late main sequence ({\textasciitilde}10 Gyr), and use Monte Carlo error analysis to determine the uncertainties on the derived circularization periods. We conclude that current theories of tidal circularization cannot account for the distribution of tidal circularization periods with population age. WIYN Open Cluster Study XXII.},

	abstract = {Following on from a recently completed radial-velocity survey of the old 
(7 Gyr) open cluster NGC 188 in which we studied in detail the
solar-type hard binaries and blue stragglers of the cluster, here we
investigate the dynamical evolution of NGC 188 through a sophisticated
N-body model. Importantly, we employ the observed binary properties of
the young (180 Myr) open cluster M35, where possible, to guide our
choices for parameters of the initial binary population. We apply
pre-main-sequence tidal circularization and a substantial increase to
the main-sequence tidal circularization rate, both of which are
necessary to match the observed tidal circularization periods in the
literature, including that of NGC 188. At 7 Gyr the main-sequence
solar-type hard-binary population in the model matches that of NGC 188
in both binary frequency and distributions of orbital parameters. This
agreement between the model and observations is in a large part due to
the similarities between the NGC 188 and M35 solar-type binaries.
Indeed, among the 7 Gyr main-sequence binaries in the model, only those
with P {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 1000 days begin to show potentially observable evidence for
modifications by dynamical encounters, even after 7 Gyr of evolution
within the star cluster. This emphasizes the importance of defining
accurate initial conditions for star cluster models, which we propose is
best accomplished through comparisons with observations of young open
clusters like M35. Furthermore, this finding suggests that observations
of the present-day binaries in even old open clusters can provide
valuable information on their primordial binary populations. However,
despite the model's success at matching the observed solar-type
main-sequence population, the model underproduces blue stragglers and
produces an overabundance of long-period circular
main-sequence-white-dwarf binaries as compared with the true cluster. We
explore several potential solutions to the paucity of blue stragglers
and conclude that the model dramatically underproduces blue stragglers
through mass-transfer processes. We suggest that common-envelope
evolution may have been incorrectly imposed on the progenitors of the
spurious long-period circular main-sequence-white-dwarf binaries, which
perhaps instead should have gone through stable mass transfer to create
blue stragglers, thereby bringing both the number and binary frequency
of the blue straggler population in the model into agreement with the
true blue stragglers in NGC 188. Thus, improvements in the physics of
mass transfer and common-envelope evolution employed in the model may in
fact solve both discrepancies with the observations. This project
highlights the unique accessibility of open clusters to both
comprehensive observational surveys and full-scale N-body simulations,
both of which have only recently matured sufficiently to enable such a
project, and underscores the importance of open clusters to the study of
star cluster dynamics.

After correcting for the influence of WASP-12's stellar companions, we find that these data rule out a cloud-free H 2 atmosphere with no additional opacity sources. We detect features in the transmission spectrum that may be attributed to metal oxides (such as TiO and VO) for an O-rich atmosphere or to metal hydrides (such as TiH) for a C-rich atmosphere. We also reanalyzed NIR transit-spectroscopy observations of WASP-12b from HST /WFC3 and broadband transit photometry from Warm Spitzer . We attribute the broad spectral features in the WFC3 data to either H 2 O or CH 4 and HCN for an O-rich or C-rich atmosphere, respectively. The Spitzer data suggest shallower transit depths than the models predict at infrared wavelengths, albeit at low statistical significance. A multi-instrument, broad-wavelength analysis of WASP-12b suggests that the transmission spectrum is well approximated by a simple Rayleigh scattering model with a planet terminator temperature of 1870 ± 130 K. We conclude that additional high-precision data and isolated spectroscopic measurements of the companion stars are required to place definitive constraints on the composition of WASP-12b's atmosphere.},

	abstract = {I calculate the physical properties of 32 transiting extrasolar planet 
and brown-dwarf systems from existing photometric observations and
measured spectroscopic parameters. The systems studied include 15
observed by the CoRoT satellite, 10 by Kepler and five by the Deep
Impact spacecraft. Inclusion of the objects studied in previous papers
leads to a sample of 58 transiting systems with homogeneously measured
properties. The Kepler data include observations from Quarter 2, and my
analyses of several of the systems are the first to be based on
short-cadence data from this satellite.

The light curves are modelled using the JKTEBOP code, with attention
paid to the treatment of limb darkening, contaminating light, orbital
eccentricity, correlated noise and numerical integration over long
exposure times. The physical properties are derived from the light-curve
parameters, spectroscopic characteristics of the host star and
constraints from five sets of theoretical stellar model predictions. An
alternative approach using a calibration from eclipsing binary star
systems is explored and found to give comparable results whilst imposing
a much smaller computational burden.

My results are in good agreement with published properties for most of
the transiting systems, but discrepancies are identified for CoRoT-5,
CoRoT-8, CoRoT-13, Kepler-5 and Kepler-7. Many of the error bars quoted
in the literature are underestimated. Refined orbital ephemerides are
given for CoRoT-8 and for the Kepler planets. Asteroseismic constraints
on the density of the host stars are in good agreement with the
photometric equivalents for HD 17156 and TrES-2, but not for HAT-P-7 and
HAT-P-11.

Complete error budgets are generated for each transiting system,
allowing identification of the observations best-suited to improve
measurements of their physical properties. Whilst most systems would
benefit from further photometry and spectroscopy, HD 17156, HD 80606,
HAT-P-7 and TrES-2 are now extremely well characterized. HAT-P-11 is an
exceptional candidate for studying starspots. The orbital ephemerides of
some transiting systems are becoming uncertain and they should be
re-observed in the near future.

The primary results from the current work and from previous papers in
the series have been placed in an online catalogue, from where they can
be obtained in a range of formats for reference and further study.

The geological activity is thought to be the result of tides raised by Jupiter, but it is not known whether the current tidal heat production is sufficiently high to generate the observed surface heat flow. Io's tidal heat comes from the orbital energy of the Io-Jupiter system (resulting in orbital acceleration), whereas dissipation of energy in Jupiter causes Io's orbital motion to decelerate. Here we report a determination of the tidal dissipation in Io and Jupiter through its effect on the orbital motions of the Galilean moons. Our results show that the rate of internal energy dissipation in Io (k2/Q = 0.015+/-0.003, where k2 is the Love number and Q is the quality factor) is in good agreement with the observed surface heat flow, and suggest that Io is close to thermal equilibrium. Dissipation in Jupiter (k2/Q =
(1.102+/-0.203)×10-5) is close to the upper bound of
its average value expected from the long-term evolution of the system, and dissipation in extrasolar planets may be higher than presently assumed. The measured secular accelerations indicate that Io is evolving inwards, towards Jupiter, and that the three innermost Galilean moons (Io, Europa and Ganymede) are evolving out of the exact Laplace
resonance.},

The presence or absence of specific changes is used to bound the values of Q (the specific dissipation function) appropriate for the planets and satellites. It is shown that the values of Q separate sharply into two groups. Values in the range from 10 to 500 are found for the terrestrial planets and satellites of the major planets. On the other hand, Q for the major planets is always larger than 6 × 10 4. Estimates of tidal dissipation in the atmospheres of the Jovian planets lead to values of Q which are consistent with those we have calculated on the basis of secular changes in the satellites' orbits. However, it is difficult to reconcile these large Q's with the much smaller values obtained in laboratory tests of solids. Lyttleton's hypothesis that Pluto is an escaped satellite of Neptune is critically examined. Using the Q's we obtain for the major planets and their satellites, we show that any eccentricity that Triton's orbit may have possessed after a near encounter with Pluto would have been subsequently damped, thus accounting for its present near-circular orbit.},

	abstract = {The negligible eccentricity of all extrasolar planets with periods less than 6 days can be accounted for by dissipation of tidal disturbances within their envelopes that are induced by their host stars. In the period range of 7-21 days, planets with circular orbits coexist with planets with eccentric orbits. These are referred to as the borderline planets. We propose that this discrepancy can be attributed to the variation in spin-down rates of young stars. In particular, prior to spin-down, dissipation of a planet's tidal disturbance within the envelope of a sufficiently rapidly spinning star can excite eccentricity growth and, for a more slowly spinning star, at least reduce the eccentricity-damping rate. In contrast, tidal dissipation within the envelope of a slowly spinning low-mass mature star can enhance the eccentricity-damping process. On the basis of these results, we suggest that short-period planets around relatively young stars may have a much larger dispersion in eccentricity than those around mature stars. We also suggest that because the rate of angular momentum loss from G and K dwarfs via stellar winds is much faster than the tidal transfer of angular momentum between themselves and their very short (3-4 days) period planets, they cannot establish a dynamical configuration in which the stellar and planetary spins are approximately parallel and synchronous with the orbital frequency. In principle, however, such configurations may be established for planets (around G and K dwarfs) with orbital periods of up to several weeks. In contrast to G and K dwarfs, the angular momentum loss due to stellar winds is much weaker in F dwarfs. It is therefore possible for synchronized short-period planets to exist around such stars. The planet around Tau Boo is one such example.},

	abstract = {We have analysed radial velocity measurements for known transiting exoplanets to study the empirical signature of tidal orbital evolution for close-in planets. Compared to standard eccentricity determination, our approach is modified to focus on the rejection of the null hypothesis of a circular orbit. We are using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of radial velocity measurements and photometric constraints, including a component of correlated noise, as well as Bayesian model selection to check if the data justify the additional complexity of an eccentric orbit. We find that among planets with non-zero eccentricity values quoted in the literature, there is no evidence for an eccentricity detection for the seven planets CoRoT-5b, WASP-5b, WASP-6b, WASP-10b, WASP-12b, WASP-17b and WASP-18b. In contrast, we confirm the eccentricity of HAT-P-16b, e= 0.034 ± 0.003, the smallest eccentricity that is reliably measured so far for an exoplanet as well as that of WASP-14b, which is the planet at the shortest period (P= 2.24 d), with a confirmed eccentricity, e= 0.088 ± 0.003. As part of the study, we present new radial velocity data using the HARPS spectrograph for CoRoT-1, CoRoT-3, WASP-2, WASP-4, WASP-5 and WASP-7 as well as the SOPHIE spectrograph for HAT-P-4, HAT-P-7, TrES-2 and XO-2. We show that the dissipative effect of tides raised in the planet by the star and vice versa explain all the eccentricity and spin-orbit alignment measurements available for transiting planets. We revisit the mass-period relation and consider its relation to the stopping mechanism of orbital migration for hot Jupiters. In addition to CoRoT-2 and HD 189733, we find evidence for excess rotation of the star in the systems CoRoT-18, HAT-P-20, WASP-19 and WASP-43.},

Both the tides the planet raises on the star and vice versa are important and dissipation efficiencies ranging over four orders of magnitude are being used. In addition, the discovery of extrasolar planets extremely close to their stars has made it clear that the estimates of the tidal quality factor, Q , of the stars based on Jupiter and its satellite system and on main-sequence binary star observations are too low, resulting in lifetimes for the closest planets orders of magnitude smaller than their age. We argue that those estimates of the tidal dissipation efficiency are not applicable for stars with spin periods much longer than the extrasolar planets' orbital period. We address the problem by applying our own values for the dissipation efficiency of tides, based on our numerical simulations of externally perturbed volumes of stellar-like convection. The range of dissipation we find for main-sequence stars corresponds to stellar Q * of 10 8 to 3 × 10 9 . The derived orbit lifetimes are comparable to or much longer than the ages of the observed extrasolar planetary systems. The predicted orbital decay transit timing variations due to the tidal coupling are below the rate of ms yr –1 for currently known systems, but within reach of an extended Kepler mission provided such objects are found in its field.},

	abstract = {As the quality and quantity of astrophysical data continue to improve, the precision with which certain astrophysical events can be timed becomes limited not by the data themselves, but by the manner, standard, and uniformity with which time itself is referenced. While some areas of astronomy (most notably pulsar studies) have required absolute time stamps with precisions of considerably better than 1 minute for many decades, recently new areas have crossed into this regime. In particular, in the exoplanet community, we have found that the (typically unspecified) time standards adopted by various groups can differ by as much as a minute. Left uncorrected, this ambiguity may be mistaken for transit timing variations and bias eccentricity measurements. We argue that, since the commonly-used Julian Date, as well as its heliocentric and barycentric counterparts, can be specified in several time standards, it is imperative that their time standards always be reported when accuracies of 1 minute are required. We summarize the rationale behind our recommendation to quote the site arrival time, in addition to using BJD\_TDB, the Barycentric Julian Date in the Barycentric Dynamical Time standard for any astrophysical event. The BJD\_TDB is the most practical absolute time stamp for extra-terrestrial phenomena, and is ultimately limited by the properties of the target system. We compile a general summary of factors that must be considered in order to achieve timing precisions ranging from 15 minutes to 1 microsecond. Finally, we provide software tools that, in principal, allow one to calculate BJD\_TDB to a precision of 1 microsecond for any target from anywhere on Earth or from any spacecraft.},

	abstract = {Duration and period of transits in extrasolar planetary systems can exhibit long-term variations for a variety of reasons. Here we investigate how systemic proper motion, which steadily re-orients planetary orbit with respect to our line of sight, affects the timing of transits. We find that in a typical system with a period of several days, proper motion at the level of 100 mas yr –1 makes transit duration vary at a rate 10-100 ms yr –1 . In some isolated systems this variation is at the measurable level (can be as high as 0.6 s yr –1 for GJ436) and may exceed all other transit-timing contributions (due to the general relativity, stellar quadrupole, etc.). In addition, proper motion causes evolution of the observed period between transits P obs via the Shklovskii effect at a rate \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] gsim 10 μs yr –1 for the nearby transiting systems (0.26 ms yr –1 in GJ436), which in some cases exceeds all other contributions to \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/700/2/965/apj300415ieqn1.gif] \${\textbackslash}dotP\_{\textbackslash}rm obs\$ . Earth's motion around the Sun gives rise to additional periodic timing signal (even for systems with zero intrinsic proper motion) allowing a full determination of the spatial orientation of the planetary orbit. Unlike most other timing effects, the proper motion signatures persist even in systems with zero eccentricity and get stronger as the planetary period increases. They should be the dominant cause of transit-timing variations in isolated wide-separation (periods of months) systems that will be sought by Kepler .},

	abstract = {We have analysed radial velocity measurements for known transiting exoplanets to study the empirical signature of tidal orbital evolution for close-in planets. Compared to standard eccentricity determination, our approach is modified to focus on the rejection of the null hypothesis of a circular orbit. We are using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of radial velocity measurements and photometric constraints, including a component of correlated noise, as well as Bayesian model selection to check if the data justify the additional complexity of an eccentric orbit. We find that among planets with non-zero eccentricity values quoted in the literature, there is no evidence for an eccentricity detection for the seven planets CoRoT-5b, WASP-5b, WASP-6b, WASP-10b, WASP-12b, WASP-17b and WASP-18b. In contrast, we confirm the eccentricity of HAT-P-16b, e= 0.034 ± 0.003, the smallest eccentricity that is reliably measured so far for an exoplanet as well as that of WASP-14b, which is the planet at the shortest period (P= 2.24 d), with a confirmed eccentricity, e= 0.088 ± 0.003. As part of the study, we present new radial velocity data using the HARPS spectrograph for CoRoT-1, CoRoT-3, WASP-2, WASP-4, WASP-5 and WASP-7 as well as the SOPHIE spectrograph for HAT-P-4, HAT-P-7, TrES-2 and XO-2. We show that the dissipative effect of tides raised in the planet by the star and vice versa explain all the eccentricity and spin-orbit alignment measurements available for transiting planets. We revisit the mass-period relation and consider its relation to the stopping mechanism of orbital migration for hot Jupiters. In addition to CoRoT-2 and HD 189733, we find evidence for excess rotation of the star in the systems CoRoT-18, HAT-P-20, WASP-19 and WASP-43.},

We present new radial velocity observations for a sample of 51 planets obtained using the Keck HIRES instrument, and find statistically significant accelerations in fifteen systems. Six of these systems have no previously reported accelerations in the published literature: HAT-P-10, HAT-P-22, HAT-P-29, HAT-P-32, WASP-10, and XO-2. We combine our radial velocity fits with Keck NIRC2 adaptive optics (AO) imaging data to place constraints on the allowed masses and orbital periods of the companions responsible for the detected accelerations. The estimated masses of the companions range between 1-500 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, with orbital semi-major axes typically between 1-75 AU. A significant majority of the companions detected by our survey are constrained to have minimum masses comparable to or larger than those of the transiting planets in these systems, making them candidates for influencing the orbital evolution of the inner gas giant. We estimate a total occurrence rate of 51\% ± 10\% for companions with masses between 1-13 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and orbital semi-major axes between 1-20 AU in our sample. We find no statistically significant difference between the frequency of companions to transiting planets with misaligned or eccentric orbits and those with well-aligned, circular orbits. We combine our expanded sample of radial velocity measurements with constraints from transit and secondary eclipse observations to provide improved measurements of the physical and orbital characteristics of all of the planets included in our survey.},

One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to ˜N2 for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our

	abstract = {We present new gravity and limb-darkening coefficients for a wide range of effective temperatures, gravities, metallicities, and microturbulent velocities. These coefficients can be used in many different fields of stellar physics as synthetic light curves of eclipsing binaries and planetary transits, stellar diameters, line profiles in rotating stars, and others. The limb-darkening coefficients were computed specifically for the photometric system of the space mission TESS and were performed by adopting the least-square method. In addition, the linear and bi-parametric coefficients, by adopting the flux conservation method, are also available. On the other hand, to take into account the effects of tidal and rotational distortions, we computed the passband gravity-darkening coefficients \$y({\textbackslash}lambda)\$ using a general differential equation in which we consider the effects of convection and of the partial derivative \${\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}partial\{{\textbackslash}ln I({\textbackslash}lambda)\}/\{{\textbackslash}partial\{{\textbackslash}ln g\}\}{\textbackslash}right)\_\{T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\}\$. To generate the limb-darkening coefficients we adopt two stellar atmosphere models: ATLAS (plane-parallel) and PHOENIX (spherical, quasi-spherical, and \$r\$-method). The specific intensity distribution was fitted using five approaches: linear, quadratic, square root, logarithmic, and a more general one with four terms. These grids cover together 19 metallicities ranging from 10\${\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$ up to 10\${\textasciicircum}\{+1\}\$ solar abundances, 0 \${\textbackslash}leq\$ log g \${\textbackslash}leq\$ 6.0 and 1500 K \${\textbackslash}leq\$ T\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$ \${\textbackslash}leq\$ 50000 K. The calculations of the gravity-darkening coefficients were performed for all plane-parallel ATLAS models.},

The algorithm searches for signals characterized by a periodic alternation between two discrete levels, with much less time spent at the lower level. We present numerical as well as analytical results to predict the possible detection significance at various signal parameters. It is shown that the crucial parameter is the effective signal-to-noise ratio - the expected depth of the transit divided by the standard deviation of the measured photometric average within the transit. When this parameter exceeds the value of 6 we can expect a significant detection of the transit. We show that the box-fitting algorithm performs better than other methods available in the astronomical literature, especially for low signal-to-noise ratios.},

The high planet mass, combined with its short orbital period, implies strong tidal coupling between the planetary orbit and the star. In fact, given its inferred age, HATS-18 shows evidence of significant tidal spin up, which together with WASP-19 (a very similar system) allows us to constrain the tidal quality factor for Sun-like stars to be in the range 6.5 {\textless}= lg(Q*/k\_2) {\textless}= 7 even after allowing for extremely pessimistic model uncertainties. In addition, the HATS-18 system is among the best systems (and often the best system) for testing a multitude of star--planet interactions, be they gravitational, magnetic or radiative, as well as planet formation and migration theories.},

We have used the data to refine the estimates of the system parameters and ephemerides. During two of the transits we observed a short-lived, low-amplitude anomaly that we interpret as the occultation of a starspot by the planet. We also found evidence for a pair of similar anomalies in previously published photometry. The recurrence of these anomalies suggests that the stellar rotation axis is nearly aligned with the orbital axis, or else the starspot would not have remained on the transit chord. By analyzing the timings of the anomalies we find the sky-projected stellar obliquity to be λ = -1{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+14{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}- 12{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} degrees. This result is consistent with (and more constraining than) a recent observation of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. It suggests that the planet migration mechanism preserved the initially low obliquity, or else that tidal evolution has realigned the system. Future applications of this method using data from the CoRoT and Kepler missions will allow spin-orbit alignment to be probed for many other exoplanets.

These eclipse depths are well fit by model emission spectra with water and other molecules in absorption, similar to those used for TrES-3 and HD 189733b. Depending on our choice of model, these results indicate that this planet has either a weak dayside temperature inversion or no inversion at all. The absence of a strong thermal inversion on this highly irradiated planet is contrary to the idea that highly irradiated planets are expected to have inversions, perhaps due the presence of an unknown absorber in the upper atmosphere. This result might be explained by the modestly enhanced activity level of WASP-4b's G7V host star, which could increase the amount of UV flux received by the planet, therefore reducing the abundance of the unknown stratospheric absorber in the planetary atmosphere as suggested in Knutson et al. We also find no evidence for an offset in the timing of the secondary eclipse and place a 2σ upper limit on {\textbar} e cos ω{\textbar} of 0.0024, which constrains the range of tidal heating models that could explain this planet's inflated radius.},

high-quality light curves and precision radial velocity measurements leads to a planetary mass of 1.22+ 0.09-0.08 MJup and a planetary radius of 1.42+
0.07-0.04 RJup. The host star is USNO-B1.0 0479-0948995, a G7 V star of visual magnitude 12.5. As a result of the short orbital period, the predicted surface temperature of the planet is 1761 K, making it an ideal candidate for detections of the secondary eclipse at infrared wavelengths.},

The aim of the present work is to refine the parameters of these systems using high cadence VLT/FORS2 z-band transit photometry and high-resolution VLT/UVES spectroscopy. For WASP-4, the new estimates for the planet radius and mass from a combined analysis of our VLT data with previously published transit photometry and radial velocities are Rp =
1.30+0.05-0.04 RJ and Mp = 1.21+0.13-0.08 M\_J, resulting in a density ρp = 0.55+0.04-0.02 ρ\_J. The
radius and mass for the host star are R\_* =
0.87+0.04-0.03 R\_⊙ and M\_* =
0.85+0.11-0.07 M\_⊙. Our ground-based
photometry reaches 550 ppm at time sampling of {\textasciitilde}50 s. Nevertheless, we also report the presence of an instrumental effect on the VLT that degraded our photometry for the WASP-5 observations. This effect could be a major problem for similar programs. Our new estimates for the parameters of the WASP-5 system are Rp = 1.09 ± 0.07
R\_J, Mp = 1.58+0.13-0.10 M\_J,
ρp = 1.23 +0.26-0.16 ρ\_J, R\_* = 1.03+0.06-0.07 R\_⊙, and M\_* =
0.96+0.13-0.09 M\_⊙. The measured size of
WASP-5b agrees well with the basic models of irradiated planets, while WASP-4b is clearly an “anomalously” large planet.

We have used the data to refine the estimates of the system parameters and ephemerides. During two of the transits we observed a short-lived, low-amplitude anomaly that we interpret as the occultation of a starspot by the planet. We also found evidence for a pair of similar anomalies in previously published photometry. The recurrence of these anomalies suggests that the stellar rotation axis is nearly aligned with the orbital axis, or else the starspot would not have remained on the transit chord. By analyzing the timings of the anomalies we find the sky-projected stellar obliquity to be λ = -1{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+14{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}- 12{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} degrees. This result is consistent with (and more constraining than) a recent observation of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. It suggests that the planet migration mechanism preserved the initially low obliquity, or else that tidal evolution has realigned the system. Future applications of this method using data from the CoRoT and Kepler missions will allow spin-orbit alignment to be probed for many other exoplanets.

Ground-based simultaneous multiband transit observations allow an accurate system parameter determination and may lead to the detection and characterization of additional bodies via the transit timing variations (TTVs) method. Aims: We aim to (i) characterize the heavily bloated WASP-4b hot Jupiter and its star by measuring system parameters and the dependence of the planetary radius as a function of four (Sloan g', r', i', z') wavelengths and (ii) search for TTVs. Methods: We recorded 987 images during three complete transits with the GROND instrument, mounted on the MPG/ESO-2.2 m telescope at La Silla Observatory. Assuming a quadratic law for the stellar limb-darkening, we derived the system parameters by simultaneous fitting a composite transit light curve over all bandpasses. To compute uncertainties of the fitted parameters, we employed the bootstrap Monte Carlo method. Results: The three central transit times are measured with precision down to 6 s. We find a planetary radius Rp = 1.413 ±
0.020 RJup, an orbital inclination i = 88.57 ° ±
0.45° and calculate a new ephemeris, a period P = 1.33823144

mid-times in combination with previous measurements shows no sign of a TTV signal greater than 20 s. We perform simplified numerical
simulations to place upper-mass limits of a hypothetical perturber in the WASP-4b system.

	abstract = {Context. Several competing scenarios for planetary-system formation and evolution seek to explain how hot Jupiters came to be so close to their parent stars. Most planetary parameters evolve with time, making it hard to distinguish between models. The obliquity of an orbit with respect to the stellar rotation axis is thought to be more stable than other parameters such as eccentricity. Most planets, to date, appear aligned with the stellar rotation axis; the few misaligned planets so far detected are massive (\&gt; 2 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}). {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: Our goal is to measure the degree of alignment between planetary orbits and stellar spin axes, to search for potential correlations with eccentricity or other planetary parameters and to measure long term radial velocity variability indicating the presence of other bodies in the system. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: For transiting planets, the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect allows the measurement of the sky-projected angle β between the stellar rotation axis and a planet's orbital axis. Using the HARPS spectrograph, we observed the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for six transiting hot Jupiters found by the WASP consortium. We combine these with long term radial velocity measurements obtained with CORALIE. We used a combined analysis of photometry and radial velocities, fitting model parameters with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. After obtaining β we attempt to statistically determine the distribution of the real spin-orbit angle ψ. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We found that three of our targets have β above 90°: WASP-2b: β = 153°{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+11{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-15{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, WASP-15b: β = 139.6°{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+5.2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-4.3{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and WASP-17b: β = 148.5°{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+5.1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-4.2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}; the other three (WASP-4b, WASP-5b and WASP-18b) have angles compatible with 0°. We find no dependence between the misaligned angle and planet mass nor with any other planetary parameter. All six orbits are close to circular, with only one firm detection of eccentricity e = 0.00848{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.00085{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.00095{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} in WASP-18b. No long-term radial acceleration was detected for any of the targets. Combining all previous 20 measurements of β and our six and transforming them into a distribution of ψ we find that between about 45 and 85\% of hot Jupiters have ψ \&gt; 30°. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Most hot Jupiters are misaligned, with a large variety of spin-orbit angles. We find observations and predictions using the Kozai mechanism match well. If these observational facts are confirmed in the future, we may then conclude that most hot Jupiters are formed from a dynamical and tidal origin without the necessity to use type I or II migration. At present, standard disc migration cannot explain the observations without invoking at least another additional process. Using observations with the high resolution échelle spectrograph HARPS mounted on the ESO 3.6 m (under proposals 072.C-0488, 082.C-0040 \&amp; 283.C-5017), and with the high resolution échelle spectrograph CORALIE on the 1.2 m Euler Swiss Telescope, both installed at the ESO La Silla Observatory in Chile.RV data is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/524/A25"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/524/A25{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

TrES-2b, TrES-4b, and CoRoT-1b in transit; TrES-3b in secondary eclipse;
and WASP-4b in both. This wavelength region includes a predicted
absorption feature from water at 1.4 μm, which we expect to be
nondegenerate with the other molecules that are likely to be abundant
for hydrocarbon-poor (e.g., solar composition) hot Jupiter atmospheres.
We divide our wavelength regions into 10 bins. For each bin we produce a
spectrophotometric light curve spanning the time of transit or eclipse.
We correct these light curves for instrumental systematics without
reference to an instrument model. For our transmission spectra, our mean
1σ precision per bin corresponds to variations of 2.1, 2.8, and
3.0 atmospheric scale heights for TrES-2b, TrES-4b, and CoRoT-1b,
respectively. We find featureless spectra for these three planets. We
are unable to extract a robust transmission spectrum for WASP-4b. For
our dayside emission spectra, our mean 1σ precision per bin
corresponds to a planet-to-star flux ratio of 1.5 ×
10-4 and 2.1 × 10-4 for WASP-4b and TrES-3b,

measurements and conclude that for both planets isothermal atmospheres

privately supplied by other authors. Half of these light curves were obtained by amateurs. From this photometry we derive 306 transit timing measurements, as well as improved planetary transit parameters.
Additionally, for 6 of these 10 stars we present a set of radial velocity measurements obtained from the spectra stored in the HARPS, HARPS-N and SOPHIE archives using the HARPS-TERRA pipeline. Our analysis of these transit timing and radial velocity data did not reveal
significant hints of additional orbiting bodies in almost all of the cases. In the WASP-4 case, we found hints of marginally significant TTV signals having amplitude 10-20 s, although their parameters are model dependent and uncertain, while radial velocities did not reveal
statistically significant Doppler signals.},

Gemini Multi-Object Spectrometers (GMOS); this is the first result from
a comparative exoplanetology survey program of close-in gas giants
conducted with GMOS. WASP-4b has an equilibrium temperature of 1700 K
and is favorable to study in transmission due to its large scale height
(370 km). We derive the transmission spectrum of WASP-4b using four
transits observed with the MOS technique. We demonstrate repeatable
results across multiple epochs with GMOS, and derive a combined
transmission spectrum at a precision about twice above photon noise,
which is roughly equal to one atmospheric scale height. The transmission
spectrum is well fitted with a uniform opacity as a function of
wavelength. The uniform opacity and absence of a Rayleigh slope from
molecular hydrogen suggest that the atmosphere is dominated by clouds
with condensate grain sizes of ˜1 μm. This result is consistent
with previous observations of hot Jupiters since clouds have been seen
in planets with similar equilibrium temperatures to WASP-4b. We describe
a custom pipeline that we have written to reduce GMOS time-series data
of exoplanet transits, and present a thorough analysis of the dominant
noise sources in GMOS, which primarily consist of wavelength- and
time-dependent displacements of the spectra on the detector, mainly due
to a lack of atmospheric dispersion correction.},

It will obtain 30 minute cadence observations of all objects in the TESS fields of view, along with two-minute cadence observations of 200,000–400,000 selected stars. The choice of which stars to observe at the two-minute cadence is driven by the need to detect small transiting planets, which leads to the selection of primarily bright, cool dwarfs. We describe the catalogs assembled and the algorithms used to populate the TESS Input Catalog (TIC), including plans to update the TIC with the incorporation of the Gaia second data release in the near future. We also describe a ranking system for prioritizing stars according to the smallest transiting planet detectable, and assemble a Candidate Target List (CTL) using that ranking. We discuss additional factors that affect the ability to photometrically detect and dynamically confirm small planets, and we note additional stellar populations of interest that may be added to the final target list.

	abstract = {Several authors have shown that precise measurements of transit time variations of exoplanets can be sensitive to other planetary bodies, such as exo-moons. In addition, the transit timing variations of the exoplanets closest to their host stars can provide tests of tidal dissipation theory. These studies, however, have not considered the effect of the host star. There is a large body of observational evidence that eclipse times of binary stars can vary dramatically due to variations in the quadrupole moment of the stars driven by stellar activity. In this paper, we investigate and estimate the likely impact such variations have on the transit times of exoplanets. We find in several cases that such variations should be detectable. In particular, the estimated period changes for WASP-18b are of the same order as those expected for tidal dissipation, even for relatively low values of the tidal dissipation parameter. The transit time variations caused by the Applegate mechanism are also of the correct magnitude and occur on time-scales such that they may be confused with variations caused by light-travel time effects due to the presence of a Jupiter-like second planet. Finally, we suggest that transiting exoplanet systems may provide a clean route (compared to binaries) to constraining the type of dynamo operating in the host star.},

While we find qualitative evidence that HJs occur less frequently in subgiants and multiple stellar systems, we conclude that our current knowledge of stellar properties and the stellar multiplicity rate is too limited for us to reach any quantitative result for the fundamental HJ occurrence rates.

# 	abstract = {A new piece of evidence supporting the photoevaporation-driven evolution model for low-mass, close-in exoplanets was recently presented by the California Kepler Survey. The radius distribution of Kepler planets inwards of 100 days is shown to be clearly bimodal, with a valley separating two peaks at 1.3 and 2.6 R\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$. Such an "evaporation-valley" had been predicted by numerical models previously. Here, we use a simple analytical model to reproduce the earlier numerical results and to demonstrate that this valley results from the following fact: the timescale for envelope erosion is the longest for those planets with He/He-rich envelopes that, while only a few percent in weight, swell their sizes by a factor of two. The timescale falls for envelopes lighter than this because, as the envelope becomes more tenuous, the planet's radius remains largely constant and so does the photo-evaporating flux it receives. The timescale also drops for heavier envelopes because the planet swells up faster than the addition of envelope mass. Photoevaporation, therefore, herds planets into either bare cores (\${\textbackslash}sim\$1.3 R\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$), or those with double the core radius (\${\textbackslash}sim\$2.6 R\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$). This fact explains both the observed valley and the steep fall-off of planets above 2.6 R\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$. The observed radius distribution further requires that the Kepler planets are clustered around 3 M\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ in mass, are endowed at birth with H/He envelopes more than a few percent in mass, and that their cores are uniformly similar to the Earth in composition. Such envelopes must have been accreted before the dispersal of the gas disks, as opposed to being outgassed, while the core composition indicates planet assembly inward of the ice-line. Lastly, photoevaporation cannot produce bare planets beyond \${\textbackslash}sim50\$ days. If such planets are present, they could indicate a second channel for planet formation.},

The frequency and main characteristics of multiple systems, and their dependence on primary mass and environment, are powerful tools to probe this process. Although early attempts were fraught with selection biases and limited completeness, instrumentation breakthroughs in the past two decades now enable robust statistical analyses. In this review, we summarize current empirical knowledge of stellar multiplicity for main sequence stars and brown dwarfs, as well as among populations of pre-main-sequence stars and embedded protostars. Among field objects, the multiplicity rate and breadth of the orbital period distribution are steep functions of the primary mass, whereas the mass ratio distribution is essentially flat for most populations other than the lowest mass objects. The time-variation of the frequency of visual companions follows two parallel, constant tracks corresponding to loose and dense stellar populations, although current observations do not yet distinguish whether initial multiplicity properties are universal or dependent on the physical conditions of the parent cloud. Nonetheless, these quantitative trends provide a rich comparison basis for numerical and analytical models of star formation.},

#     observational setup (nights observed, bandpass, exposure time, telescope diameter, 
#     detector characteristics), site properties (seeing, sky background), and the planet 
#     properties (frequency, period, and radius). We find that for typical parameters, 
#     the detection probability is maximized for I-band observations. At fixed planet 
#     period and radius, the signal-to-noise ratio of a planetary transit in the I band 
#     is weakly dependent on the mass of the primary for sources with flux above the sky

#     targets, the number of detectable planets is roughly proportional to the number of 
#     stars with transiting planets with fluxes above sky (and not necessarily the number 
#     of sources with photometric error less than a given threshold).
#     Furthermore, for rising mass functions, the majority of the planets will be

#     spread function (PSF) to study whether they are the responsible for the
#     dimming found in Kepler light curves, 2./ study the change in the
#     stellar and planetary parameters caused by an unresolved object, 3./
#     help validate the Kepler objects of interest (KOI) that do not have any
#     object inside the Kepler PSF, and 4./ study the multiplicity rate of
#     planet-host candidates. Such a large sample of observed planet-host
#     candidates allows us to derive statistics for close (visual or bounded)
#     companions to the harboring star. Methods: We present lucky
#     imaging observations for a total of 98 KOIs. This technique is based on
#     the acquisition of thousands of very-short-exposure-time images. A
#     selection and combination of a small amount of the highest quality
#     frames provides a high resolution image with objects having a 0.1 arcsec
#     PSF. We apply this technique to carry out observations in the Sloan i
#     and z filters of our Kepler candidates. Results: We find blended
#     objects inside the Kepler PSF for a significant percentage of KOIs. On
#     the one hand, only 58.2\% of the hosts do not have any object within 6
#     arcsec. On the other hand, we find 19 companions closer than 3 arcsec in
#     17 KOIs. According to their magnitudes and i - z colors, 8 of them could
#     be physically bound to the host star.},

#     abstract = {Context. The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of planet 
#     candidates. Currently, some of them have already been discarded; more
#     than 200 have been confirmed by follow-up observations (most by radial
#     velocity and few by other methods), and several hundreds have been
#     validated. However, the large majority of the candidates are still
#     awaiting for confirmation. Thus, priorities (in terms of the probability
#     of the candidate being a real planet) must be established for subsequent
#     radial velocity observations. Aims: The motivation of this work
#     is to provide a set of isolated (good) host candidates to be further
#     tested by other techniques that allow confirmation of the planet. As a
#     complementary goal, we aim to identify close companions of the
#     candidates that could have contaminated the light curve of the planet
#     host due to the large pixel size of the Kepler CCD and its typical PSF
#     of around 6 arcsec. Both goals can also provide robust statistics about
#     the multiplicity of the Kepler hosts. Methods: We used the
#     AstraLux North instrument located at the 2.2 m telescope in the Calar
#     Alto Observatory (Almería, Spain) to obtain diffraction-limited
#     images of 174 Kepler objects of interest. A sample of demoted Kepler
#     objects of interest (with rejected planet candidates) is used as a
#     control for comparison of multiplicity statistics. The lucky-imaging
#     technique used in this work is compared to other adaptive optics and
#     speckle imaging observations of Kepler planet host candidates. To that
#     end, we define a new parameter, the blended source confidence level
#     (BSC), to assess the probability of an object to have blended
#     non-detected eclipsing binaries capable of producing the detected
#     transit. Results: We find that 67.2\% of the observed Kepler hosts
#     are isolated within our detectability limits, and 32.8\% have at least
#     one visual companion at angular separations below 6 arcsec. Indeed, we
#     find close companions (below 3 arcsec) for the 17.2\% of the sample. The
#     planet properties of this sample of non-isolated hosts are revised
#     according to the presence of such close companions. We report one
#     possible S-type binary (KOI-3158), where the five planet candidates
#     would orbit one of the components of the system. We also report three
#     possible false positives (KOIs 1230.01, 3649.01, and 3886.01) due to the
#     presence of close companions that modify candidate properties such that
#     they cannot be considered as planets anymore. The BSC parameter is
#     calculated for all the isolated targets and compared to both the value
#     prior to any high-resolution image and, when possible, to observations
#     from previous high-spatial resolution surveys in the Kepler sample.

#     detection threshold for each star in terms of the number and time
#     baseline of the observations, and the underlying “noise”
#     from measurement errors, intrinsic stellar jitter, or additional
#     low-mass planets. We show that all planets with orbital periods P 
#     {\textless}
#     2000 days, velocity amplitudes K {\textgreater} 20 m s-1, and
#     eccentricities e ≲ 0.6 have been announced, and we summarize the

These stars have at least one stellar companion within 2", and the planets have measured masses and radii, allowing an estimate of their bulk density. The transit dilution by the companion star requires the planet radii to be revised upward, even if the planet orbits the primary star; as a consequence, the planetary bulk density decreases. We find that, if planets orbited a faint companion star, they would be more volatile-rich, and in several cases their densities would become unrealistically low, requiring large, inflated atmospheres or unusually large mass fractions in a H/He envelope. In addition, for planets detected in radial velocity data, the primary star has to be the host. We can exclude 14 planets from orbiting the companion star; the remaining 15 planets in seven planetary systems could orbit either the primary or the secondary star, and for five of these planets the decrease in density would be substantial even if they orbited the primary, since the companion is of almost equal brightness as the primary. Substantial follow-up work is required in order to accurately determine the radii of transiting planets. Of particular interest are small, rocky planets that may be habitable; a lower mean density might imply a more volatile-rich composition. Reliable radii, masses, and thus bulk densities will allow us to identify which small planets are truly Earth-like.},

This is the first time that a single, uniform spectroscopic analysis has been made for every star on a large Doppler planet search survey. We identify a subset of 850 stars that have Doppler observations sufficient to detect uniformly all planets with radial velocity semiamplitudes K{\textgreater}30 m s-1 and orbital periods shorter than 4 yr. From this subset of stars, we determine that fewer than 3\% of stars with

A power-law fit to these data relates the formation probability for gas giant planets to the square of the number of metal atoms. High stellar metallicity also appears to be correlated with the presence of multiple-planet systems and with the total detected planet mass. This data set was examined to better understand the origin of high metallicity in stars with planets. None of the expected fossil
# signatures of accretion are observed in stars with planets relative to the general sample: (1) metallicity does not appear to increase as the mass of the convective envelopes decreases, (2) subgiants with planets do not show dilution of metallicity, (3) no abundance variations for Na, Si, Ti, or Ni are found as a function of condensation temperature, and (4) no correlations between metallicity and orbital period or
# eccentricity could be identified. We conclude that stars with extrasolar planets do not have an accretion signature that distinguishes them from other stars; more likely, they are simply born in higher metallicity molecular clouds.

# 	abstract = {We develop a general method to fit the underlying planetary distribution function (PLDF) to exoplanet survey data. This maximum likelihood method accommodates more than one planet per star and any number of planet or target star properties. We apply the method to announced Kepler planet candidates that transit solar-type stars. The Kepler team's estimates of the detection efficiency are used and are shown to agree with theoretical predictions for an ideal transit survey. The PLDF is fit to a joint power law in planet radius, down to 0.5 R ⊕ , and orbital period, up to 50 days. The estimated number of planets per star in this sample is 0.7-1.4, where the range covers systematic uncertainties in the detection efficiency. To analyze trends in the PLDF we consider four planet samples, divided between shorter and longer periods at 7 days and between large and small radii at 3 R ⊕ . The size distribution changes appreciably between these four samples, revealing a relative deficit of 3 R ⊕ planets at the shortest periods. This deficit is suggestive of preferential evaporation and sublimation of Neptune- and Saturn-like planets. If the trend and explanation hold, it would be spectacular observational support of the core accretion and migration hypotheses, and would allow refinement of these theories.},

We verify the integrity of the stellar parameters through comparisons with asteroseismic studies and Gaia parallaxes. We also recompute planetary radii for 2025 planet candidates. Because knowledge of planetary radii is often limited by uncertainties in stellar size, we improve the uncertainties in planet radii from typically 42\% to 11\%.

# 	abstract = {The California-Kepler Survey (CKS) is an observational program to improve our knowledge of the properties of stars found to host transiting planets by NASA's Kepler Mission. The improvement stems from new high-resolution optical spectra obtained using HIRES at the W. M. Keck Observatory. The CKS stellar sample comprises 1305 stars classified as Kepler Objects of Interest, hosting a total of 2075 transiting planets. The primary sample is magnitude-limited (Kp {\textless} 14.2) and contains 960 stars with 1385 planets. The sample was extended to include some fainter stars that host multiple planets, ultra short period planets, or habitable zone planets. The spectroscopic parameters were determined with two different codes, one based on template matching and the other on direct spectral synthesis using radiative transfer. We demonstrate a precision of 60 K in effective temperature, 0.07 dex in surface gravity, 0.04 dex in [Fe/H], and 1.0 km/s in projected rotational velocity. In this paper we describe the CKS project and present a uniform catalog of spectroscopic parameters. Subsequent papers in this series present catalogs of derived stellar properties such as mass, radius and age; revised planet properties; and statistical explorations of the ensemble. CKS is the largest survey to determine the properties of Kepler stars using a uniform set of high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra. The HIRES spectra are available to the community for independent analyses.},

# 	abstract = {HATSouth is the world's first network of automated and homogeneous telescopes that is capable of year-round 24 hr monitoring of positions over an entire hemisphere of the sky. The primary scientific goal of the network is to discover and characterize a large number of transiting extrasolar planets, reaching out to long periods and down to small planetary radii. HATSouth achieves this by monitoring extended areas on the sky, deriving high precision light curves for a large number of stars, searching for the signature of planetary transits, and confirming planetary candidates with larger telescopes. HATSouth employs six telescope units spread over three prime locations with large longitude separation in the southern hemisphere (Las Campanas Observatory, Chile; HESS site, Namibia; Siding Spring Observatory, Australia). Each of the HATSouth units holds four 0.18 m diameter f /2.8 focal ratio telescope tubes on a common mount producing an 8.2° × 8.2° field of view on the sky, imaged using four 4 K × 4 K CCD cameras and Sloan r filters, to give a pixel scale of 3.7” pixel -1 . The HATSouth network is capable of continuously monitoring 128 square arc degrees at celestial positions moderately close to the anti-solar direction. We present the technical details of the network, summarize operations, and present detailed weather statistics for the three sites. Robust operations have meant that on average each of the six HATSouth units has conducted observations on 500 nights over a 2 years time period, yielding a total of more than 1 million science frames at a 4 minute integration time and observing 10.65 hr day -1 on average. We describe the scheme of our data transfer and reduction from raw pixel images to trend-filtered light curves and transiting planet candidates. Photometric precision reaches 6 mmag at 4 minute cadence for the brightest non-saturated stars at r \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] ≈ 10.5. We present detailed transit recovery simulations to determine the expected yield of transiting planets from HATSouth. We highlight the advantages of networked operations, namely, a threefold increase in the expected number of detected planets, as compared to all telescopes operating from the same site.},

#     using the California-Kepler Survey (CKS) dataset. Our occurrence rates 
#     leverage the high-purity CKS planet catalog with precise planet radii and 
#     host star metallicities. Metallicity M is correlated with planet 
#     occurrence for some, but not all, planet sizes and orbital periods. We 
#     model the planet-metallicity correlation as \$d f {\textbackslash}propto 
#     10{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}beta M\} d M\$, where 
#     \${\textbackslash}beta\$ characterizes the strength of this correlation. 
#     For warm super-Earths having orbital periods \$P = 10-100\$ days and radii 
#     \$R\_P = 1.0-1.7{\textasciitilde}R\_E\$, we observe no correlation, with

#     abstract = {The Kepler Mission began its 3.5 year photometric monitoring campaign in 2009 May on 
#     a select group of approximately 150,000 stars. The stars were chosen from the half million in the 
#     field of view that are brighter than 16th magnitude. The selection criteria are quantitative 
#     metrics designed to optimize the scientific yield of the mission with regard to the detection of 
#     Earth-size planets in the habitable zone. This yields more than 90,000 G-type stars on or close 
#     to the main sequence, {\textgreater}20, 000 of which are brighter than 14th magnitude. At the 
#     temperature extremes, the sample includes approximately 3000 M-type dwarfs and a small sample of 
#     O- and B-type MS stars ({\textless}200). The small numbers of giants are included in the sample:

#     period less than 25 days and host star brighter than Kepler magnitude

#     Companionship is established by the uniquely red F814W-F1042M colors of
#     the binary components, caused by heavily pressure-broadened K I
#     absorption centered at 7665 and 7699 Å. The separations of the two

#     projected separations of 3.17+/-0.14 and 1.0+/-0.3 AU, respectively.
#     These close separations are similar to those found in previous brown
#     dwarf binary searches and permit orbital mapping over the coming decade.
#     2MASS 1225-2739AB has a substantially fainter secondary, with
#     ΔMF814W=1.59+/-0.04 and
#     ΔMF1042M=1.05+/-0.03 this system is likely composed of

#     newly derive rotation periods from the Kepler light curves for all of the

#     less than 4 to 135 m s –1 , yet the stars all have amplitudes of 
#     photometric variability less than 3 mmag, reflecting the preference of the 
#     RV program for chromospherically "quiet" stars. Despite the small size of 
#     our sample, we find with high statistical significance that the RV rms 
#     manifests strongly in the Fourier power spectrum of the light curve: stars

#     abstract = {We report on 176 close ({\textless}2″) stellar companions 
#     detected with 
#     high-resolution imaging near 170 hosts of Kepler Objects of Interest
#     (KOIs). These Kepler targets were prioritized for imaging follow-up
#     based on the presence of small planets, so most of the KOIs in these
#     systems (176 out of 204) have nominal radii {\textless}6 
#     \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus .
#     Each KOI in our sample was observed in at least two filters with
#     adaptive optics, speckle imaging, lucky imaging, or the Hubble Space
#     Telescope. Multi-filter photometry provides color information on the
#     companions, allowing us to constrain their stellar properties and assess
#     the probability that the companions are physically bound. We find that
#     60\%-80\% of companions within 1″ are bound, and the bound
#     fraction is {\textgreater}90\% for companions within 0.″5 the bound 
#     fraction
#     decreases with increasing angular separation. This picture is consistent
#     with simulations of the binary and background stellar populations in the
#     Kepler field. We also reassess the planet radii in these systems,
#     converting the observed differential magnitudes to a contamination in
#     the Kepler bandpass and calculating the planet radius correction factor,
#     X R = R p (true)/R p (single).
#     Under the assumption that planets in bound binaries are equally likely
#     to orbit the primary or secondary, we find a mean radius correction
#     factor for planets in stellar multiples of X R = 1.65. If
#     stellar multiplicity in the Kepler field is similar to the solar
#     neighborhood, then nearly half of all Kepler planets may have radii
#     underestimated by an average of 65\%, unless vetted using high-resolution
#     imaging or spectroscopy.},

Abstract:

  Combining data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)
  with previous studies, we show that the transit times of WASP-4b are
  incompatible with a constant orbital period.  In particular, the
  transits seem to have arrived $77.8 \pm 10.7$ seconds early, and the
  period appears to be shrinking by $\dot{P}=-12.1 \pm 1.2$ milliseconds
  per year.   From TESS observations of WASP-6b, WASP-18b, and WASP-46b,
  we show that a systematic offset between the TESS time stamps and the
  barycentric reference sufficient to explain WASP-4b is ruled out at
  6.3$\sigma$.  If the timing variations are astrophysical, major
  contributors to the period change could include either apsidal
  precession, or tidal decay.  The doppler shift from WASP-4's
  acceleration towards us could account for at most one quarter of the
  observed period change (at $2\sigma$).  Further transit and
  occultation studies will help confirm the reality of the timing
  variation, and eventually determine its cause.

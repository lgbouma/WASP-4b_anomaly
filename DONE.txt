- do step 2: upload to wiki

- ask Joel+Gaspar to observe it with CHAT from LCO on the Dec 10/11 transit.
  - partials --> better than 1 minute precision unlikely. will have to
    wait until June 2019.

  - step 2: make wiki page.

  - step 3: contact
    POC: Roland (roland@space.mit.edu)
    TSO: seager@mit.edu, dlatham@cfa.harvard.edu
    SPOC: jon.jenkins@nasa.gov,
    asking for 3 contributing authors from each list.
    Add these 9 contributors coauthors to the 6 TESS architect
    coauthors.

- got SPOC

- update the text with the corrected tau_e timescale. (Section 4.2,
  apsidal precession discussion)

- add new coauthors
  - T. Daylan
  - K. Stassun
  - S. Kane

- in Kozai-Lidov subsection, add the bit you get for free.

- add a simple calculation of the RV O-C limit you get for free from Triaud et
  al 2010.

- discussion: apsidal precession subsection:
  - look into RVs to see what the residual variance is once the
    WASP-4b model is subtracted out.
  X do the RV data rule out a 2:1 MMR?
  - what are limits on the outer planet, if there is one?


- read Cohen+ 2010

  Cohen+ 2010 studied how the presence of hot Jupiters affects the magnetized
  wind of a main sequence star. They found that for 4>a/Rstar>10, the hot Jupiter
  seemed to be able to make the angular momentum loss from the wind less
  efficient.

  For Penev+ 2018's Qstar measurements from tidal spin-up, this might be
  problematic. The overall effect would be to make the HJ hosts spin faster,
  which if attributed to tides would lead to Qstar values biased slightly low. I
  have no idea whether the effect is actually important, and I couldn't find much
  follow-up work on this question.

- read the new Millholland & Laughlin paper

- in tidal discussion, note:

Millholland & Laughlin (2018) propose that an obliquity tide, in lieu of an
eccentricity tide, equilibrium tide, or dynamical tide, might explain the
changing apparent period of WASP-12b.  This is consistent with the
sky-projected obliquity $\lambda = 59^{+15}_{-20}^\circ$ measured by Albrecht
et al (2012).  From Rossiter measurements and spot-crossings, WASP-4b seems to
be aligned with its host star (Triaud et al 2010; Sanchis-Ojeda et al 2011).
Therefore the obliquity tide explanation also falls short.

- ask Jean Michel-Desert, and Huitson, if they really do believe their
  midtimes. (this is essential!)

- include J.M. Desert as coauthor

- you've hit the 20-author count. so shift the affiliations elsewhere?
  not so nice to just move everything to "et al"...

  - basically did it

- make the table (a small one) for your system parameters.
- update all system parameter table numbers
- update caption with caveat
- correct error bar on +/-. they add linearly, not in quadrature.
  >>> 9.428449720144272 + 5.350645025935923
  14.779094746080194
- intro: need to choose your stellar parameters (either Keivan's,
  or others), and stick with them.
- look into Stassun's stellar analysis
  - the empirical Mstar is low. that's somewhat janky...
    - this was because we didn't use the updated spectroscopic parameters
  - pick your preferred set of stellar parameters
  - do the empirical thing?
    - yes.
- no. the errors add in quadrature. cf.
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty#Example_formulas

  >>> ( (9.428449720144272)**2 + (5.350645025935923)**2 )**(1/2)
  10.8

- run write-up by keivan to see if he finds it acceptable
  x what is the angular radius?
  - what is the parallax?

VAGUE IDEAS PERHAPS TO BE INCLUDED IN DISCUSSION
----------

x what is the expected rotation period?

x when does the radius start changing for this star, based on the
  best-fit MESA model?

- how solid is the "slightly evolved" interpretation?

x leave the theory tasks -- the state of the stellar evolution, the
  gyro age and rotation period, etc.  ... FOR THE DISCUSSION.

- tidal discussion: shorten ur discussion of Penev's work.

----------
- tidal discussion: limit to
  - equilibrium tide
  - dynamical tide
  - obliquity tide

- add text "transits" and "occultations" to the O-C charts

- go thru text, identify where quality needs to be improved.
  - save current version as a "verbose draft"
  x then cut to meet the ApJL requirement.
    - perhaps not. we need this appendix. ApJ it is.

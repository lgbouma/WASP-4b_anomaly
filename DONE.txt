- do step 2: upload to wiki

- ask Joel+Gaspar to observe it with CHAT from LCO on the Dec 10/11 transit.
  - partials --> better than 1 minute precision unlikely. will have to
    wait until June 2019.

  - step 2: make wiki page.

  - step 3: contact
    POC: Roland (roland@space.mit.edu)
    TSO: seager@mit.edu, dlatham@cfa.harvard.edu
    SPOC: jon.jenkins@nasa.gov,
    asking for 3 contributing authors from each list.
    Add these 9 contributors coauthors to the 6 TESS architect
    coauthors.

- got SPOC

- update the text with the corrected tau_e timescale. (Section 4.2,
  apsidal precession discussion)

- add new coauthors
  - T. Daylan
  - K. Stassun
  - S. Kane

- in Kozai-Lidov subsection, add the bit you get for free.

- add a simple calculation of the RV O-C limit you get for free from Triaud et
  al 2010.

- discussion: apsidal precession subsection:
  - look into RVs to see what the residual variance is once the
    WASP-4b model is subtracted out.
  X do the RV data rule out a 2:1 MMR?
  - what are limits on the outer planet, if there is one?


- read Cohen+ 2010

  Cohen+ 2010 studied how the presence of hot Jupiters affects the magnetized
  wind of a main sequence star. They found that for 4>a/Rstar>10, the hot Jupiter
  seemed to be able to make the angular momentum loss from the wind less
  efficient.

  For Penev+ 2018's Qstar measurements from tidal spin-up, this might be
  problematic. The overall effect would be to make the HJ hosts spin faster,
  which if attributed to tides would lead to Qstar values biased slightly low. I
  have no idea whether the effect is actually important, and I couldn't find much
  follow-up work on this question.

- read the new Millholland & Laughlin paper

- in tidal discussion, note:

Millholland & Laughlin (2018) propose that an obliquity tide, in lieu of an
eccentricity tide, equilibrium tide, or dynamical tide, might explain the
changing apparent period of WASP-12b.  This is consistent with the
sky-projected obliquity $\lambda = 59^{+15}_{-20}^\circ$ measured by Albrecht
et al (2012).  From Rossiter measurements and spot-crossings, WASP-4b seems to
be aligned with its host star (Triaud et al 2010; Sanchis-Ojeda et al 2011).
Therefore the obliquity tide explanation also falls short.

- ask Jean Michel-Desert, and Huitson, if they really do believe their
  midtimes. (this is essential!)

- include J.M. Desert as coauthor

- you've hit the 20-author count. so shift the affiliations elsewhere?
  not so nice to just move everything to "et al"...

  - basically did it

- make the table (a small one) for your system parameters.
- update all system parameter table numbers
- update caption with caveat
- correct error bar on +/-. they add linearly, not in quadrature.

- intro: need to choose your stellar parameters (either Keivan's,
  or others), and stick with them.
- look into Stassun's stellar analysis
  - the empirical Mstar is low. that's somewhat janky...
    - this was because we didn't use the updated spectroscopic parameters
  - pick your preferred set of stellar parameters
  - do the empirical thing?
    - yes.
- no. the errors add in quadrature. cf.

- run write-up by keivan to see if he finds it acceptable
  x what is the angular radius?
  - what is the parallax?

VAGUE IDEAS PERHAPS TO BE INCLUDED IN DISCUSSION
----------

x what is the expected rotation period?

x when does the radius start changing for this star, based on the
  best-fit MESA model?

- how solid is the "slightly evolved" interpretation?

x leave the theory tasks -- the state of the stellar evolution, the
  gyro age and rotation period, etc.  ... FOR THE DISCUSSION.

- tidal discussion: shorten ur discussion of Penev's work.

----------
- tidal discussion: limit to
  - equilibrium tide
  - dynamical tide
  - obliquity tide

- add text "transits" and "occultations" to the O-C charts

- go thru text, identify where quality needs to be improved.
  - save current version as a "verbose draft"
  x then cut to meet the ApJL requirement.
    - perhaps not. we need this appendix. ApJ it is.

- Spin-orbit precession from stellar quadrupole was inferred from transit shape
  and duration variations in Kepler-13 (Szabo+ 2012, 2014, Masuda+ 2015).
  In particular from Masuda+ 2015:
  "...our analysis confirms that the observed TDVs are actually due to the
  variation in cos iorb, further supporting the precession scenario with the
  more realistic model of the asymmetric transit light curve."
  They got the stellar J2 from this.
  "This variation is consistent with the precession of the stellar spin and
  orbital angular momenta around the total angular momentum of the system,
  induced by the oblateness of the rapidly rotating host star."

- Same story for PTFO 8-8695, studied by Barnes et al (2013), 

- Mills 2017, in his thesis, discussing Kepler 108.

- From Masuda (2017):
"However, there has been no direct measurement of a large orbital misalignment
between WJs and their outer companions such that it might induce a large
eccentricity oscillation, partly because these systems are mostly detected with
the radial velocity (RV) technique, which yields no information on the orbital
direction. Notable exceptions include the Kepler-419 system (Dawson et al.
2014) and the doubly transiting giant-planet system Kepler-108 (Mills &
Fabrycky 2017), where the mutual inclinations were constrained via dynamical
modeling of transit timing and duration variations (TTVs and TDVs), although
their mutual inclinations are likely too small to drive secular eccentricity
oscillations."

- "In particular, I confirm a large mutual orbital inclination between the inner
WJ and the companion in the latter system, which can induce a large amplitude
of the eccentricity oscillation and the tidal shrinkage of the inner orbit
(Section 6)—exactly as predicted in the “slow Kozai” scenario by a close
companion. The companions’ properties, however, are not fully compatible with
such migration starting from beyond the snow line. Thus I also assess the
possibility of in situ formation (Section 6.3)."

- Kane quotes gammadot = -0.0191 +/- 0.0068 m/s/day.
  Knutson quotes gammadot = -0.0099 +/- 0.0052 m/s/day.

  the error on the difference (quadrature sum) is 0.0086 m /s / day.

  the difference is
  kane - knutson =  -0.0092 +/- 0.0086 m/s/day.

  the 2 sigma limit from kane value is

  gammadot = -0.0191 - 2*0.0069 = -0.0329

  * is this to be believed? probably not, but let's find out.

  This is a factor of 1.56x greater than before, and since the Pdot goes
  linearly, while we formerly had 9e-11, this would mean doppler Pdot < 1.41e-10.

  So this would mean at most one third of the Pdot could be from doppler.

  Uncomfortable.

x Precessing orbital planes were observed in CBPs:
  Kepler 413, precession period 11 years (Kostov+ 2014)
  Kepler 453, precession period ~103 years (Welsh+ 2015)

- draft off to JNW.


  * Kane: what does his independent RV analysis turn up?


==========================================
Tue 11 Dec 2018 01:20:37 PM EST

- include Keivan's broadband photometry sentence.

- double-check all the literature times.
  - verify you correctly copied in the Hoyer+ 2013 times.
    - i double checked by reading the tables, and my spreadsheet.

  - collect the individual times that Hoyer collected yourself.

  - rerun Eastman conversion on the above times. Does anything change?
    - answer: no.

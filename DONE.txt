- read Cohen+ 2010

  Cohen+ 2010 studied how the presence of hot Jupiters affects the magnetized
  wind of a main sequence star. They found that for 4>a/Rstar>10, the hot Jupiter
  seemed to be able to make the angular momentum loss from the wind less
  efficient.

  For Penev+ 2018's Qstar measurements from tidal spin-up, this might be
  problematic. The overall effect would be to make the HJ hosts spin faster,
  which if attributed to tides would lead to Qstar values biased slightly low. I
  have no idea whether the effect is actually important, and I couldn't find much
  follow-up work on this question.

- read the new Millholland & Laughlin paper

- in tidal discussion, note:

Millholland & Laughlin (2018) propose that an obliquity tide, in lieu of an
eccentricity tide, equilibrium tide, or dynamical tide, might explain the
changing apparent period of WASP-12b.  This is consistent with the
sky-projected obliquity $\lambda = 59^{+15}_{-20}^\circ$ measured by Albrecht
et al (2012).  From Rossiter measurements and spot-crossings, WASP-4b seems to
be aligned with its host star (Triaud et al 2010; Sanchis-Ojeda et al 2011).
Therefore the obliquity tide explanation also falls short.

- ask Jean Michel-Desert, and Huitson, if they really do believe their
  midtimes. (this is essential!)

- include J.M. Desert as coauthor

- you've hit the 20-author count. so shift the affiliations elsewhere?
  not so nice to just move everything to "et al"...

- Spin-orbit precession from stellar quadrupole was inferred from transit shape
  and duration variations in Kepler-13 (Szabo+ 2012, 2014, Masuda+ 2015).
  In particular from Masuda+ 2015:
  "...our analysis confirms that the observed TDVs are actually due to the
  variation in cos iorb, further supporting the precession scenario with the
  more realistic model of the asymmetric transit light curve."
  They got the stellar J2 from this.
  "This variation is consistent with the precession of the stellar spin and
  orbital angular momenta around the total angular momentum of the system,
  induced by the oblateness of the rapidly rotating host star."

- Same story for PTFO 8-8695, studied by Barnes et al (2013), 

- Mills 2017, in his thesis, discussing Kepler 108.

- From Masuda (2017):
"However, there has been no direct measurement of a large orbital misalignment
between WJs and their outer companions such that it might induce a large
eccentricity oscillation, partly because these systems are mostly detected with
the radial velocity (RV) technique, which yields no information on the orbital
direction. Notable exceptions include the Kepler-419 system (Dawson et al.
2014) and the doubly transiting giant-planet system Kepler-108 (Mills &
Fabrycky 2017), where the mutual inclinations were constrained via dynamical
modeling of transit timing and duration variations (TTVs and TDVs), although
their mutual inclinations are likely too small to drive secular eccentricity
oscillations."

- "In particular, I confirm a large mutual orbital inclination between the inner
WJ and the companion in the latter system, which can induce a large amplitude
of the eccentricity oscillation and the tidal shrinkage of the inner orbit
(Section 6)—exactly as predicted in the “slow Kozai” scenario by a close
companion. The companions’ properties, however, are not fully compatible with
such migration starting from beyond the snow line. Thus I also assess the
possibility of in situ formation (Section 6.3)."

- Kane quotes gammadot = -0.0191 +/- 0.0068 m/s/day.
  Knutson quotes gammadot = -0.0099 +/- 0.0052 m/s/day.

  the error on the difference (quadrature sum) is 0.0086 m /s / day.

  the difference is
  kane - knutson =  -0.0092 +/- 0.0086 m/s/day.

  the 2 sigma limit from kane value is

  gammadot = -0.0191 - 2*0.0069 = -0.0329

  * is this to be believed? probably not, but let's find out.

  This is a factor of 1.56x greater than before, and since the Pdot goes
  linearly, while we formerly had 9e-11, this would mean doppler Pdot < 1.41e-10.

  So this would mean at most one third of the Pdot could be from doppler.

  Uncomfortable.

x Precessing orbital planes were observed in CBPs:
  Kepler 413, precession period 11 years (Kostov+ 2014)
  Kepler 453, precession period ~103 years (Welsh+ 2015)

- draft off to JNW.


  * Kane: what does his independent RV analysis turn up?


==========================================
Tue 11 Dec 2018 01:20:37 PM EST

- include Keivan's broadband photometry sentence.

- double-check all the literature times.
  - verify you correctly copied in the Hoyer+ 2013 times.
    - i double checked by reading the tables, and my spreadsheet.

  - collect the individual times that Hoyer collected yourself.

  - rerun Eastman conversion on the above times. Does anything change?
    - answer: no.

- introduction: include better text for precession, e.g.,:

  For the Kepler CBPs, photodynamical modeling for Kepler 413 (Kostov+ 2014) and
  Kepler 453 (Welsh+ 2015) found that the planetary orbits precessed, and so the
  transit times and durations changed. The precession there is driven by the
  quadrupole of the inner binary.

  There have also been measurements of precession in single-star systems due to a
  rapidly spinning host star. The duration variations in Kepler-13 are due to
  variations in the orbital inclination (Szabo+ 2012, 2014, Masuda+ 2015). Same
  story in PTFO 8-8695 (Barnes+ 2013).

  Finally, photodynamical modeling of various Kepler systems has turned up
  various instances of precessing orbits. The two clearest cases are systems of
  two giant planets, on mutually inclined orbits: Kepler-108 (Mills & Fabrycky
  2016) and Kepler-693 (Masuda 2017) show this effect. Precession of the inner
  one is observed through both timing and duration variations.

  None of these are hot Jupiters, on slightly eccentric orbits, precessing
  because of the quadrupole from the planet's tidal bulge. So while the claim
  isn't technically wrong, it's wrong enough that I'll reword it ;-)

WINN COMMENTS WIP I

- Why not fit for a/R and inclination?  Taking them from an external source
  seems chancy.  I had recommended finding a lightcurve solution using all the
  TESS data, and then fitting individual transits after fixing all parameters
  except the midpoint and the linear function.

  - Good point. I misunderstood the initial suggestion for how to run this part
    of the analysis.

  - Now done.

  - paper reflects it.

- Is it clearly documented that the TESS time stamps represent ‘mid exposure’
  times, i.e., the one-minute mark, for the 2-minute summed images?

  - as clear as possible. but a double-check from Jon or Ed has been requested.

- For estimating the photometric uncertainties, it is probably better to use
  out-of-transit data, rather than residuals of the in-transit data.  The
  general principle is to avoid too much involvement with a theoretical model.
  The in-transit data may be affected by starspots or other failures of the
  model.

  - changed to using OOT points.

- Fitting a segment spanning 20 transit durations seems excessive. Is a linear
  model really good enough to describe the variation over such a long interval
  of time?

  - the residuals looked fine by eye. I have changed this to +/- 5 transit
    durations.  (I had actually already done this in the code, but forgot to
    update the paper).

- The longitude of periastron is not well defined for e=0.  Do you mean “time
  of conjunction” or “longitude at a particular reference time”?

  - I meant a number that was needed to initialize code but otherwise had no
    useful meaning.

- On page 4, you compare the MAD (presumably median absolute deviation) with
  various expectations.  Are the expected values expressed as an rms value?  If
  so, then a correction is needed, because the MAD and rms are generally not the
  same.  For a Gaussian distribution, the rms is about 1.5 times the MAD.

  - The expected values are expressed as an RMS. So I was comparing apples to
    oranges. I've now taken to measuring the RMS, not the MAD, and have updated
    the text accordingly.

- Also, explain where 69.184 comes from.
  - done

- Fig. 1 [hour] —> [hours]

- In Fig. 2, the black TESS points are crammed together too closely.  Include a
second panel with just the TESS times.  Or, have the figure reach across two
columns, and use an inset panel to show the TESS data?

- In the legend: “literature prediction” —> “pre-TESS ephemeris”.

- I don’t like separating the points into “top half” and “bottom half”
  according to uncertainty. This implies a sharp division when in fact there
  is no sharp division. Can you plot all the data points in the same style, but
  somewhat transparent, so you can see them all?  Or use opacity to encode
  precision?

  - this problem is insane. sent JNW options for comments.

- “The TESS observations arrived early.”  One example of many with strange
syntax.  Better: “The transits observed by TESS occurred earlier than
expected.”

- Sec. 4.1 first paragraph - significance of ‘convective zones’ will not be
  clear to the reader.

- seek out and destroy examples of weird syntax!
  - abstract
  - method "observations" section
  - all figure captions
  - method contd...
  - rest of the thing.

- Are you sure that HD 209458 and HD 189733 are the only cases of hot Jupiters
  for which we have bounded ecosw at the level 10^-3?  There are so many hot
  Jupiters for which occultations have been observed with Spitzer.

  - no, so I've softened the wording.


X “We correspondingly added 69.184 seconds…” The error is systematic, not
statistical.  I don’t think it makes sense to treat it as a two-sided error to
be added in quadrature. 

  X so do we just omit the time? I've updated the "method" to just add the
  uncertainty (rather than doing it quadrature), and have added a sentence to
  indicate that we know this is a bad thing, but that there isn't a clearly
  better way to do it. (Except asking the authors what the time standard is).

  The relevant text now reads:
  "We assumed the standard was UTC, but added $32.182 + N$ seconds of
  uncertainty to the reported errors, where $N=35$ is the appropriate number of
  leap-seconds \citep[see][]{eastman_achieving_2010}.  Though not rigorous, this
  procedure inflates the error bar to a more realistic $\pm$94 seconds."

  What do you think?

  - Don't do this. Just use the original uncertainty.

  - update the text

X In the abstract, why not mention an additional planet as a possible
  explanation?

  X is it not a "sub-explanation" for apsidal precession? Unless you mean
  the direct gravitational forcing?


X What do you think of trying your hand at a mass/period exclusion diagram, based
  on the existing RV data?  There are probably many ways to do so.  One would be:
  Remove the WASP-4 signal.  Then for each trial period and phase, fit and remove
  a linear trend.  Then fit a sinusoid of the given period and phase, and
  increase the amplitude of a sinusoid until \Delta\chi^2 exceeds (say) 9.
  Record the amplitude.  Repeat for a grid of periods and phases.  Plot the
  maximum amplitude as a function of period - hopefully there will be a well
  defined envelope.

  X I'm not convinced right now that this is the right RV analysis.  The
  Csizmadia_2018_WASP18b_love_number paper is maybe a better direction...

  X JNW: "I don't think it would be worthwhile to search for apsidal precession
  using these data.  The signal takes the form of a phase shift, and the time
  sampling of these (RV) data is not well suited for measuring a phase shift with
  great confidence."

  X this could take up to a week, which is cutting it a bit too close.

x Another test you might try (or that a referee may suggest) is to refit after
  omitting a single data point.  Repeat for all possible choices of data point.
  Treat the TESS data as a single data point.  Besides the TESS datum, are there
  others that are individually crucial for the conclusion that the period is not
  constant?

  X this seems rather excessive for the time being... the answer by inspection is
  that the TESS data point is most important, the first few are somewhat
  important for curvature, and the middle is important for precision.
  Should we treat the Huitson+ 2017 data points as "a single data point"?
  What about that Spitzer time? ...

- Kane/Tansu: working out the O-C RV residuals for the Pdot model
  - Tansu: ditto.

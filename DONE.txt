- do step 2: upload to wiki

- ask Joel+Gaspar to observe it with CHAT from LCO on the Dec 10/11 transit.
  - partials --> better than 1 minute precision unlikely. will have to
    wait until June 2019.

  - step 2: make wiki page.

  - step 3: contact
    POC: Roland (roland@space.mit.edu)
    TSO: seager@mit.edu, dlatham@cfa.harvard.edu
    SPOC: jon.jenkins@nasa.gov,
    asking for 3 contributing authors from each list.
    Add these 9 contributors coauthors to the 6 TESS architect
    coauthors.

- got SPOC

- update the text with the corrected tau_e timescale. (Section 4.2,
  apsidal precession discussion)

- add new coauthors
  - T. Daylan
  - K. Stassun
  - S. Kane

- in Kozai-Lidov subsection, add the bit you get for free.

- add a simple calculation of the RV O-C limit you get for free from Triaud et
  al 2010.

- discussion: apsidal precession subsection:
  - look into RVs to see what the residual variance is once the
    WASP-4b model is subtracted out.
  X do the RV data rule out a 2:1 MMR?
  - what are limits on the outer planet, if there is one?


- read Cohen+ 2010

  Cohen+ 2010 studied how the presence of hot Jupiters affects the magnetized
  wind of a main sequence star. They found that for 4>a/Rstar>10, the hot Jupiter
  seemed to be able to make the angular momentum loss from the wind less
  efficient.

  For Penev+ 2018's Qstar measurements from tidal spin-up, this might be
  problematic. The overall effect would be to make the HJ hosts spin faster,
  which if attributed to tides would lead to Qstar values biased slightly low. I
  have no idea whether the effect is actually important, and I couldn't find much
  follow-up work on this question.

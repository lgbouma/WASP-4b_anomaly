Dear Dr. Lintott,

We thank you for organizing the review of our paper, and thank the
referee for their helpful comments.  We have considered the referee's
remarks carefully and revised our manuscript accordingly.

Below, we have reproduced the referee's report, along with our
point-by-point responses. A list of changes is also appended to the
manuscript using the usual AASTeX macros.

Sincerely,

Luke Bouma

REFEREE COMMENT
----------
Page 8, 4th paragraph:
You mention you choose a fixed saturation level of 8x10^4 ADU, which you
consider "slightly" greater than the Vanderspek at al. saturation level
of ~4x10^4 ADU. Can you please check if one of the values has a typo,
since the chosen level is twice the other level (or justify in whoat
sense this is only a slight difference).

RESPONSE
----------
> We have changed the wording in the text from "slightly" to "a factor
> of two greater than", and clarified the relevant sentence. The
> paragraph now reads:
>
> """
> After subtracting the background, we mask out saturated pixels using a
> fixed saturation level of $8\times10^4$ analog-to-digital units (ADU).
> This value was chosen based on the onset of bleeding charge trails in
> the images, and is a factor of two greater than the saturation level of
> $2\times10^5$ electrons, or about $4\times10^4\,{\rm ADU}$, reported by
> \citet{vanderspek_2018}.  As a consequence, we do not analyze stars
> brighter than $T\approx 6.5, even though the TESS CCID-80 CCDs conserve
> charge across bloom trails up to at least $T\approx 4$
> \citet{vanderspek_2018}.
> """
>
> For context, we're not particularly worried about going a factor of
> two over Vanderspek's stated saturation level because stars with <8e4
> ADU show blooming trails that are quite short, and so much of the flux
> is still captured in our circular apertures. If we go much higher
> though, more of the flux falls outside our apertures (the charge
> trails get longer), and difference imaging + circular aperture
> photometry really isn't the correct data reduction approach. The
> smarter thing is to use the photons in the bleed trails via "column
> apertures" (e.g., Tim White and Benjamin Pope's work on K2 and now
> also TESS).

REFEREE COMMENT

Page 21, last paragraph:
It would be good if you could make the link stand out more from the main
text (even though it is in the abstract), since the light curves are the
main product of the work presented in the paper.

Dear Dr. Jackson,

We thank you for organizing the review of our paper, and also
thank the referee for their helpful comments.  We have
considered the referee's remarks carefully and revised our
manuscript accordingly.

Below, we have reproduced the relevant portions of the
referee's report, alongside our responses. A list of changes is
appended to the manuscript using the trackchanges AASTeX
macros.

Sincerely,

Luke Bouma

Section 2.1, Paragraph 2.

It would be helpful if the authors briefly describe the exact
meaning of "high quality" in the context of the transit times
used in the analysis.

RESPONSE

REFEREE COMMENT

Section 3.1

In this section it is stated that the assumption of "a Gaussian
likelihood and sampling over the posterior probability
distributions" is made. This assumption needs further
justification given the variety of data sources included. In
particular, it is later stated in Section 3.1 that the cause of
the high reduced chi2 values "must be some additional signal or
noise". Alternatively, it could indeed mean that the Gaussian
likelihood assumption is not completely valid.

Section 3.3

The discussion and figure in this section are very good.
However, it is not sufficiently demonstrated that a stellar
companion is ruled out when considering the possible angular
separations of the companion resulting from being near inferior
or superior conjunction. This is particularly important for
this system since even a small degree of coplanarity of the
companion with WASP-4b would result in an edge on orbit that
makes the companion difficult to detect when near conjunction
locations. Also, the very last sentence of this section "Figure
4 shows the result." should describe the results of the figure
in more detail.

Section 4.1

Paragraph 1. The paragraph implies that the Doppler effect is
the sole cause of the timing derivative. However, and given the
2 sigma discrepancy, the wording should allow for the
possibility that the timing derivative is actually a result of
a combination of the described effects.

RESPONSE
----------
> We have modified the wording in this paragraph to clarify
> that this is a possibility, but that at present the dominant
> physical effect is the line-of-sight acceleration.

Section 4.2

Paragraph 3. "hot Jupiters is expected" should be "hot Jupiters
are expected".

RESPONSE
----------
> Corrected, thank you.

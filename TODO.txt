TODO:

- fix local detrending problem JNW points out for the phase-folded lightcurve

  - when constructing the phase-folded light curve, fit a line to the OOT flux
    data, and use the parameters of the best-fitting line to "rectify" each
    lightcurve.

  - add this description to the text
    - check by JNW

  - run fits again once you fix this local detrending problem JNW is pointing
    out from the entire lightcurve.

    - measure times
    - python retrieve_measured_times.py --ticid 402026209
    - python make_parameter_vs_epoch_plots.py
    - python compute_planet_star_parameters.py
      - update table accordingly
    * python model_comparison_linear_quadratic_precession.py | tee ../results/model_comparison/WASP-4b/model_comparison_output.txt
    * ./make_all

  * push the result through all the numbers in the text.

* request feedback from collaborators

* submit: once you hear back from collaborators.

* post to arxiv: once you have an editor

* send draft to jeremy.

* check whether not doing the f=0.76 fudge factor changes anything (probably
  just inflates uncertainties). --> would it appreciably reduce certainty of
  period decay? if so, would bear mentioning!


PUBLISHING
----------

* inform architects (tess-architects@mit.edu) and contributors,
  including a draft, asking for response within three business days,
  with the statement:

  "I have read the paper “Title”, and I agree with the methods and
  conclusions. I wish to be included as a co-author." 

* step 4: once complete draft is ready, post draft to TESS wiki
  contributed paper page.

===============================================================================

ONCE PAPER IS SUBMITTED
----------
* notify Princeton media office of result.

* notify Erin May of the result, ask if they would be willing to share

* Email Caceres after submitting. plz confirm UTC, not TDB.

* Consider contacting Andrew Howard, to get a few HIRES RV observations, to
  extend the linear trend pointed out by Knutson et al 2014. i don't think new
  ones have been taken in a while.  (a planet should be there...)

  * ... is WASP-4 up soon from Hawaii?

* schedule in further ground-based follow-up next season.
  * get some magellan time to observe an occultation / transit?


EVENTUAL READING
----------
* Verbunt and Phinney ~1995
* Zhan 1978 -- relative rates of tidal dissipation around evolved stars vs
  not-evolved stars.  Explains why more evolved stars -> more dissipation.
* what is "slow Kozai" (Petrovich 2015)

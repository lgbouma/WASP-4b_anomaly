MOST PRESSING
----------

* tidal discussion: shorten ur discussion of Penev's work.

* tidal discussion: limit to
  * equilibrium tide
  * dynamical tide
  * obliquity tide

* intro: need to choose your stellar parameters (either Keivan's,
  or others), and stick with them.

* Jean-Michel spitzer times.
  * include his times
  
  * re-run full analysis. (only after stellar parameters are good too).

* go thru text, identify where quality needs to be improved.

  * save current version as a "verbose draft"

  * then cut to meet the ApJL requirement.

----------

- look into Stassun's stellar analysis
  * the empirical Mstar is low. that's somewhat janky...
  * pick your preferred set of stellar parameters
  * do the empirical thing?

* Kane/Tansu: working out the O-C residuals for the Pdot model, to understand
  that limit more carefully.
  * Kane: what does his independent RV analysis turn up?
  * Tansu: ditto.

* do we want "media coverage", thru the media office?

* we should maybe get some HIRES RV observations, to extend the linear trend
  pointed out by Knutson et al 2014. i don't think new ones have been taken in
  a while.  (a planet should be there...)

  * ... is WASP-4 up soon from Hawaii?


OTHER READING
----------

* Verbunt and Phinney ~1995

* Zhan 1978 -- relative rates of tidal dissipation around evolved stars vs
  not-evolved stars.  Explains why more evolved stars -> more dissipation.


VAGUE IDEAS PERHAPS TO BE INCLUDED IN DISCUSSION
----------

* what is the expected rotation period?

* when does the radius start changing for this star, based on the
  best-fit MESA model?

* how solid is the "slightly evolved" interpretation?

* leave the theory tasks -- the state of the stellar evolution, the
  gyro age and rotation period, etc.  ... FOR THE DISCUSSION.


ONCE PAPER IS SUBMITTED
----------
* notify Erin May of the result, ask if they would be willing to share



PUBLISHING
----------

* follow steps of TESS publication policy.

  * step 4: once complete draft is ready, post draft to TESS wiki
    contributed paper page.

  * inform architects (tess-architects@mit.edu) and contributors,
    including a draft, asking for response within three business days,
    with the statement:

    "I have read the paper “Title”, and I agree with the methods and
    conclusions. I wish to be included as a co-author."

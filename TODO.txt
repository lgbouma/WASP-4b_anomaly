* maybe include a mention of "slow Kozai" (Petrovich 2015)

====================
Winn comments:

X In the abstract, why not mention an additional planet as a possible
  explanation?

  X is it not a "sub-explanation" for apsidal precession? Unless you mean
  the direct gravitational forcing?

X Fig. 3 Again the individual TESS points are not helpful. Here, plot the
  binned point only.  Omit “best” from legend labels.
  
  X I respectfully disgaree -- we're using all the TESS times in the fit, so we
    should put them on the plot, I think!

X “We correspondingly added 69.184 seconds…” The error is systematic, not
statistical.  I don’t think it makes sense to treat it as a two-sided error to
be added in quadrature. 

  X so do we just omit the time? I've updated the "method" to just add the
  uncertainty (rather than doing it quadrature), and have added a sentence to
  indicate that we know this is a bad thing, but that there isn't a clearly
  better way to do it. (Except asking the authors what the time standard is).

  The relevant text now reads:
  "We assumed the standard was UTC, but added $32.182 + N$ seconds of
  uncertainty to the reported errors, where $N=35$ is the appropriate number of
  leap-seconds \citep[see][]{eastman_achieving_2010}.  Though not rigorous, this
  procedure inflates the error bar to a more realistic $\pm$94 seconds."

  What do you think?

- make a phase folded and binned, high-SNR light curve. Check for any
  persistent glitches or asymmetry.

  - i have already checked for persistent glitches and/or asymmetry in the
    per-transit residual lightcurves. they didn't show much. perhaps one or two
    spot-crossings, at low significance.
  - initial fit done
  * want a phased plot where you can see the residual (?)

* seek out and destroy examples of weird syntax!

* Another test you might try (or that a referee may suggest) is to refit after
  omitting a single data point.  Repeat for all possible choices of data point.
  Treat the TESS data as a single data point.  Besides the TESS datum, are there
  others that are individually crucial for the conclusion that the period is not
  constant?

* Are you sure that HD 209458 and HD 189733 are the only cases of hot Jupiters
  for which we have bounded ecosw at the level 10^-3?  There are so many hot
  Jupiters for which occultations have been observed with Spitzer.

* What do you think of trying your hand at a mass/period exclusion diagram, based
  on the existing RV data?  There are probably many ways to do so.  One would be:
  Remove the WASP-4 signal.  Then for each trial period and phase, fit and remove
  a linear trend.  Then fit a sinusoid of the given period and phase, and
  increase the amplitude of a sinusoid until \Delta\chi^2 exceeds (say) 9.
  Record the amplitude.  Repeat for a grid of periods and phases.  Plot the
  maximum amplitude as a function of period - hopefully there will be a well
  defined envelope.


====================

* recompute Table 1 (stellar/transit) parameters consistently with the
  redetermined values.

* Jean-Michel spitzer times.
  * include his times
  * re-run full analysis. (ensure stellar parameters are good in code too).

* Kane/Tansu: working out the O-C RV residuals for the Pdot model
  * Tansu: ditto.

* do we want "media coverage", thru the media office?

ONCE PAPER IS SUBMITTED
----------
* notify Erin May of the result, ask if they would be willing to share

* we should maybe get some HIRES RV observations, to extend the linear trend
  pointed out by Knutson et al 2014. i don't think new ones have been taken in
  a while.  (a planet should be there...)

  * ... is WASP-4 up soon from Hawaii?

* schedule in further ground-based follow-up next season.
  * get some magellan time to observe an occultation / transit?

PUBLISHING
----------

* inform architects (tess-architects@mit.edu) and contributors,
  including a draft, asking for response within three business days,
  with the statement:

  "I have read the paper “Title”, and I agree with the methods and
  conclusions. I wish to be included as a co-author." 

* step 4: once complete draft is ready, post draft to TESS wiki
  contributed paper page.

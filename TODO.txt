MOST PRESSING
----------

TODO:

* add the Pdotdot model

* add Caldwell, Guerrero, Wohler as coauthors

* add Fei Dai as coauthor for RV analysis

* add acknowledgement of Bixel and his efforts

* decide whether to include Bixel's three points. 

  * assess Bixel's "fudge factor of 2". Why 2? Why not 4? Or 10?  ...

  * what sort of systematics are in the LC extraction process for them? ...
    could I just measure the times, from their LCs, please? ... (at least then
    I might trust the error bars...)

  * how does this compare to ETD uncertainties

* if include, rerun fits with Bixel's three points. how do they change things,
  if at all?

  * add paragraph to summarize the process that produced them...

* if do not include, then include mention in the acknowledgements.

* cite Buhler+ 2016 somewhere in text (perhaps).
  * what is the story of HAT-P-13? how did they get k_love,p? and core mass?
  ... should be aware!!

----------

* post to arxiv: once you have a response

* notify Princeton media office of result.
  - send email to hear about what options there are
  * once hear back from referee: reach out again

* Consider contacting Andrew Howard, to get a few HIRES RV observations, to
  extend the linear trend pointed out by Knutson et al 2014. i don't think new
  ones have been taken in a while.  (a planet should be there...)

  * ... is WASP-4 up soon from Hawaii?
    - not great. usually terrible seeing time.

  * get HARPS RVs over the summer, via KESPRINT.
    * will Winn impose it? or should I?

* schedule in further ground-based follow-up next season.
  * get some magellan time to observe an occultation / transit?

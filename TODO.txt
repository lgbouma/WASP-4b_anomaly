MOST PRESSING
----------
* draft off to JNW.

* Jean-Michel spitzer times.
  * include his times
  * re-run full analysis. (ensure stellar parameters are good in code too).

* Kane/Tansu: working out the O-C RV residuals for the Pdot model
  * Kane: what does his independent RV analysis turn up?
  * Tansu: ditto.

* do we want "media coverage", thru the media office?

----------

* Verbunt and Phinney ~1995

* Zhan 1978 -- relative rates of tidal dissipation around evolved stars vs
  not-evolved stars.  Explains why more evolved stars -> more dissipation.


ONCE PAPER IS SUBMITTED
----------
* notify Erin May of the result, ask if they would be willing to share

* we should maybe get some HIRES RV observations, to extend the linear trend
  pointed out by Knutson et al 2014. i don't think new ones have been taken in
  a while.  (a planet should be there...)

  * ... is WASP-4 up soon from Hawaii?

* schedule in further ground-based follow-up next season.
  * get some magellan time to observe an occultation / transit?

PUBLISHING
----------

* inform architects (tess-architects@mit.edu) and contributors,
  including a draft, asking for response within three business days,
  with the statement:

  "I have read the paper “Title”, and I agree with the methods and
  conclusions. I wish to be included as a co-author." 

* step 4: once complete draft is ready, post draft to TESS wiki
  contributed paper page.

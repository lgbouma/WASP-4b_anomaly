TODO:

* notify Princeton media office of result.
  - send email to hear about what options there are
  * once you've resubmitted (and are waiting to go to proofing stage): reach
    out again

* Consider contacting Andrew Howard, to get a few HIRES RV observations, to
  extend the linear trend pointed out by Knutson et al 2014. i don't think new
  ones have been taken in a while.  (a planet should be there...)

  * ... is WASP-4 up soon from Hawaii?
    rises from hawaii in May. Sets in December.

  * get HARPS RVs over the summer, via KESPRINT.
    * will Winn impose it? or should I?

* schedule in further ground-based follow-up next season.
  * get some magellan time to observe an occultation / transit?

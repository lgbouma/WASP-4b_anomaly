MOST PRESSING
----------

* update the text with the corrected tau_e timescale. (Section 4.2,
  apsidal precession discussion)

* discussion: apsidal precession subsection:

  * look into RVs to see what the residual variance is once the
    WASP-4b model is subtracted out.

  * do the RV data rule out a 2:1 MMR?

  * what are limits on the outer planet, if there is one?


* once the above two things are done: go thru text, identify where
  quality needs to be improved.

  * save current version as a "verbose draft"

  * then cut to meet the ApJL requirement.

* do we want "media coverage", thru the media office?


OTHER READING
----------

* read Cohen+ 2010

* Verbunt and Phinney ~1995

* Zhan 1978 -- relative rates of tidal dissipation around evolved stars vs
  not-evolved stars.  Explains why more evolved stars -> more dissipation.


VAGUE IDEAS PERHAPS TO BE INCLUDED IN DISCUSSION
----------

* what is the expected rotation period?

* when does the radius start changing for this star, based on the
  best-fit MESA model?

* how solid is the "slightly evolved" interpretation?

* leave the theory tasks -- the state of the stellar evolution, the
  gyro age and rotation period, etc.  ... FOR THE DISCUSSION.



ONCE PAPER IS SUBMITTED
----------
* ask Jean Michel-Desert, and Huitson, if they really do believe their
  midtimes. (this is essential!)

* ask Erin May for her data / collaborate
   * get the midtime from it.


PUBLISHING
----------

* follow steps of TESS publication policy.

  * step 4: once complete draft is ready, post draft to TESS wiki
    contributed paper page.
    inform architects (tess-architects@mit.edu) and contributors,
    including a draft, asking for response within three business days,
    with the statement:

    "I have read the paper “Title”, and I agree with the methods and
    conclusions. I wish to be included as a co-author."

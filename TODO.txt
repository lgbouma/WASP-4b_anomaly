MOST PRESSING
----------

* recompute the t_mid uncertainties using your updated WASP-4b transit times.
  * (i.e. retrieve from pickles, run that, & fix the directory paths)

* rerun everything using Spitzer points!

* actually use your stellar parameters in the wasp-4 analysis / all subsequent
  numbers.

X Fig. 3 Again the individual TESS points are not helpful. Here, plot the
  binned point only.  Omit “best” from legend labels.
  
  X I respectfully disgaree -- we're using all the TESS times in the fit, so we
    should put them on the plot, I think!

 * Winn thinks: might as well hide 'em! Because they hide the message.

 * On fig 2, add band for the binned time. No red point.
 * Acquiesce 

- make a phase folded and binned, high-SNR light curve. Check for any
  persistent glitches or asymmetry.

  - i have already checked for persistent glitches and/or asymmetry in the
    per-transit residual lightcurves. they didn't show much. perhaps one or two
    spot-crossings, at low significance.
  - initial fit done
  * want a phased plot where you can see the residual (?)
  * want an extra figure in the paper for this?
    * yes, do this!

* Jean-Michel spitzer times.
  * include his times
  * re-run full analysis. (ensure stellar parameters are good in code too).


ONCE PAPER IS SUBMITTED
----------
* notify Princeton media office of result.

* notify Erin May of the result, ask if they would be willing to share

* Email caceres after submitting.

* we should maybe get some HIRES RV observations, to extend the linear trend
  pointed out by Knutson et al 2014. i don't think new ones have been taken in
  a while.  (a planet should be there...)

  * ... is WASP-4 up soon from Hawaii?

* schedule in further ground-based follow-up next season.
  * get some magellan time to observe an occultation / transit?

PUBLISHING
----------

* inform architects (tess-architects@mit.edu) and contributors,
  including a draft, asking for response within three business days,
  with the statement:

  "I have read the paper “Title”, and I agree with the methods and
  conclusions. I wish to be included as a co-author." 

* step 4: once complete draft is ready, post draft to TESS wiki
  contributed paper page.


EVENTUAL READING
----------
* Verbunt and Phinney ~1995
* Zhan 1978 -- relative rates of tidal dissipation around evolved stars vs
  not-evolved stars.  Explains why more evolved stars -> more dissipation.
* what is "slow Kozai" (Petrovich 2015)

MOST PRESSING
----------

TODO:

* fix the log-likelihood transit "period" vs "per" bug lines 1571 and 1613 of
  lcfit.py
  
  * probably also add an assertion to force correct key names in passed
    dictionaries.

* verify that not doing the f=0.76 fudge factor doesn't change
  anything (probably just inflates uncertainties). --> would it
  appreciably reduce certainty of period decay? if so, would bear mentioning!

PUBLISHING
----------

* inform architects (tess-architects@mit.edu) and contributors,
  including a draft, asking for response within three business days,
  with the statement:

  "I have read the paper “Title”, and I agree with the methods and
  conclusions. I wish to be included as a co-author." 

* step 4: once complete draft is ready, post draft to TESS wiki
  contributed paper page.

===============================================================================

ONCE PAPER IS SUBMITTED
----------
* notify Princeton media office of result.

* notify Erin May of the result, ask if they would be willing to share

* Email Caceres after submitting. plz confirm UTC, not TDB.

* Consider contacting Andrew Howard, to get a few HIRES RV observations, to
  extend the linear trend pointed out by Knutson et al 2014. i don't think new
  ones have been taken in a while.  (a planet should be there...)

  * ... is WASP-4 up soon from Hawaii?

* schedule in further ground-based follow-up next season.
  * get some magellan time to observe an occultation / transit?


EVENTUAL READING
----------
* Verbunt and Phinney ~1995
* Zhan 1978 -- relative rates of tidal dissipation around evolved stars vs
  not-evolved stars.  Explains why more evolved stars -> more dissipation.
* what is "slow Kozai" (Petrovich 2015)
